Pure strain humans (PSH) are often referred to as Homo Sapiens.
The exhausting title of pure strain human is abbreviated to PSH.
PSH are the collection of upright, bipedal humanoids which inhabit our planet earth.
The qualifier “Pure Strain” implies nothing to support bigoted aspirations and PSH’s can choose from any human ethnicity: African, Asian, Indian, Hispanic, Caucasian, etc.
Pure strain humans are simply upright, bipedal humanoids who possess no purported mythical abilities other than those described here.
None of the varieties of the human animal are in any way more proficient at any one task than another.
Physical abilities are described by class, rolled attributes and mutations and nothing else.
Almost every shred of literature devised involves the actions of at least some PSH.
A few of the most famous PSH are listed here: Luke Skywalker (Star Wars), Jim and Angelina DiGriz (Stainless Steel Rat) and Indiana Jones (Raiders of the Lost Ark).</p>
