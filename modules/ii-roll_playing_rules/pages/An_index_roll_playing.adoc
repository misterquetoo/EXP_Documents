.. affects the persona in that moment
.. have a success, tie fail outcome
. Random rolls 
.. deterministic 
.. randomly decide a skill, Toy or description
.. may be good, bad or indifferent, but not success fail

.Success Rolls
. Static Rolls (one roll vs fixed number)
.. To Hit Roll
.. Saving Throws
.. Attribute Checks - within one persona (same as a save?)
.. PT Rolls
. Dynamic Rolls (one roll vs one roll)
.. Attribute Challenge - between 2 personas
.. Sphincter Dice

== Embrace the KiloDie?
Not likely. 
Best done as a fork from the dice heavy game.

== Embrace the High Roll
Things that build the things to break the things.

* player describes success 
* success desired determines die used


// strive for the goal of high rolls always win.
