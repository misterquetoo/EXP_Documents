Janitorial bots, very simply, clean up.
If the bots INT is 12 or greater, they will be of the domestic variety.
The domestic bot is designed to clean up constantly changing domestic landscapes where anything can randomly occur.
The industrial type, on the other hand, is tended to work in a pre-programmed factory which is highly regulated and supposedly self-sufficient.
Industrial bots roll their size on the outdoor table, while the domestics use the indoor table.

Both types of janitorial bot are equipped with vacuums, sweepers, detergents, toilet plungers anD other such paraphernalia necessary for decreasing the entropy of the universe.
These bots can also act as part-time sentries or can be ordered to go get specific tooLs or types of food.
