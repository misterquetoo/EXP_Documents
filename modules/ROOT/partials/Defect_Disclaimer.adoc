.*This mutation is a defect.* 
If this mutation is acquired as a startup mutation, it should not count as a mutation.
Startup defects allow the player to generate an additional mutation startup mutation.
Defects can pile on during startup.

If this mutation is acquired as part gameplay (de novo), it should count as a mutation.
De Novo mutations from pharma, or radiation, are not paired with a non-defective mutation.
