= Data Analyzer

// table insert 27

Data Analyzers are tin-can thinkers that tend to be the most insane type of robot  
for, as we all know, intelligence breeds insanity.
They are so stuffed with artificial intelligence that it is not uncommon for them to be moody  
dwelling, as they tend to do, too much on their and the worlds ills.
Most analog monitors have a semi-organic form of central computing unit that is so complex it can have a mental mutation.
The chance for an analog monitor to mutate mentally is equal to four times the robots base races chance for a mental mutation.
This is determined in http://expgame.com/?page_id=364[Chapter 58: Mental Mutations].
So a Type D robot with a canine base race would have a 40% chance of a mental mutation.
The base race of a robot is determined in this chapter under step (3) Base Race.
