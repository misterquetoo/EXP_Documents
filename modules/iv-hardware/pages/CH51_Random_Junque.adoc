= Random Junque

The title of this chapter is completely self explanatory.
The tables contained in here are filled with lists of completely useless equipment.
It is almost certain that these artifacts have existed in every society in one form or another.
Random junque is useless equipment, but if the persona can somehow make use of it during the campaign, then that is fantastic.
There should be copious EXPS awards for players that turn nothing into something.
Random junque is not entirely worthless, it has a random value of 1 to 10 eps, and #each piece of random junque has a 10% chance of having a spare part useful to a mechanic.#

To generate random junque the player makes one roll on Table 51.0, +++<i>+++Random Junque, +++</i>+++and then #refers to the designated table type.
Random junque does not count as a roll for players generating start #up Toys.+++<figure id="attachment_5349" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5349" style="width: 213px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i2.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/random_Junque_Bin-213x300.png?resize=213%2C300[One anthro's garbage is another anthro's junk.,213]](https://i1.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/random_Junque_Bin.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5349" class="wp-caption-text">+++One anthro's garbage is another anthro's junk.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== 16) Ref's Own Table 

The ref's own table for random junque should consist of those useless things that are found in the culture that she is creating.
It may be a bit cynical, but this system is created with the belief that their will always be waste, incompetence and corruption available to waste corporate, and government dollars on useless items.
Another thing to consider is whether or not it is worth having a refs own table for random junque.
There are lots of things to prepare for the referee already, and unless random junque is really offering something humorous to the milieu then may she should go do something #else.
