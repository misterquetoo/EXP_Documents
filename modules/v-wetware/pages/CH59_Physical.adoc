= Physical Mutations

Physical mutations physically alter the mutant's body.
The effects of physical mutations take place within the physical space.
Physical mutations are not subtle and usually alter the mutant's appearance.
The changes can range from oversized ears to wings to disgusting faux organs.
Even the most cursory vet exam would expose this mutant as different.

== Mutation Types

=== Acidic Enzymes 

[horizontal]
Range:: 1h per Adjusted PSTR
Duration:: Constant
Frequency:: Alternating Units
General Bonus:: Combat Ratio +2

This mutant has a muscular hyperactive stomach that produces excess amounts of acid and digestive enzymes.
The mutant can eject spittle of corrosive acids.
The mutant's esophagus, mouth and lips are covered in thick protective skin, and her teeth are small and gnarled.
Her thickened upper digestive tract protects the mutant from the corrosive acid, but the rest of her body is vulnerable.
Spitting on herself would give the mutant severe acid burns.

In the duress of combat, she can release one spittle every other unit.
If the mutant wins an attack roll, her spittle will burn her target.
The acid spittle inflicts 2-16 (2d8) HPS of damage plus one hit point per EXPS level.
Thus a 3rd level mutant with a 12 PSTR could spit acid 15 hexes and inflict 5 to 19 hit points of corrosive damage.

Damage from this digestive acid attack permanently damages organic tissues, preventing them from spontaneously regenerating.
The digestive juices do not affect inorganic materials.
A food culture will not grow after being bitten by a creature with this mutation.
The mutant will probably have a penchant for more spicy foods.
Swallowing acidic compounds will not affect the mutant much.
Kissing is out of the question unless her partner also has this mutation.

=== Adaptation 

[horizontal]
Range:: Persona Only
Duration:: Special
Frequency:: Constant
General Bonus:: Combat Ratio *3

The immune system of this mutant works on a macroscopic level. 
Adaptation allows the mutant to develop immunity to any threat from the physical space.
Her body can adapt to fire, physical force, poison, radiation, and diseases.
Adaptation is automatic, and her body will attempt to transform itself to prevent further damage.
If an attack harms the mutant, there is a chance that her body will adapt to the attack.

The mutant's constitution and intelligence determine if she will adapt to an attack. 

=== Adaptation Chance
.% chance = CON + INT + EXPS Level
****
A 4th level mutant with a 12 CON and a 11 INT has a 27% chance of adaptation.
****

If the player wins the roll, the persona will adapt to the threat.
A bacterial infection could be pushed out through her skin or redirected to her stomach for digestion.
A punch to the face would restructure her skin and muscle to counter the next punch.
The mutant's nervous system would safely ground an electro weapon attack.
Her lungs would trap a poisonous gas and excrete it as sweat.
However, the mutant's body may recognize a healing pharma as foreign and reject that as well.

Adaptation does not differentiate a friend from a foe. 
So even benevolent pharma could be blocked by this super immune system.
Adaptation does not have the best memory either.
Most adaptations will disappear after the mutant has a restful sleep.
There is a small chance that an adaptation will remain permanently.

There is a 1% chance per EXPS Level of the mutant becoming permanently adapting to the threat.
So the mutant could become permanently immune to punches, lazer bolts, or healing pharma.
The permanent adaptations are particular.
The mutant would be immune to damage by punches, but not claws or talons or clubs.
The mutant would be immune to a healing pharma pill, but not a healing pharma injection.

The mutant can stay permanently immune to one attack per EXPS Level. 
A fifth level mutant could have permanent immunity to 5 attack types. 
If she develops permanent immunity to a 6th adaptation, the mutation will forget the oldest one.  

=== Attraction Odor 

[horizontal]
Range:: 1km per PSTR
Duration:: Special
Frequency:: Constant
General Bonus:: +2 CHA, +15 on negotiation rolls

Attraction odour makes this mutant very interesting to a specific type of persona. 
The mutation uses pheromones, chemotactic agents, tasty aromas, vibrations, and thought patterns.
These factors work together to attract less intelligent personas to the mutant.
A specific flying insect may surround the mutant. 
A herd of nomadic fauna may change course to follow her.
A lone, hungry alien may attack the mutant because she simultaneously resembles dinner and love. 

Attraction odour works best on flora or fauna, but more intelligent personas can succumb as well.
The attracted persona will seek out the mutant. 
When the persona finally finds the mutant, the creature will realize neither food nor a mate is present.
If the attracted persona wins a poison roll, she will most likely wander off disappointed. 
The intensity of the poison is equal to the mutant's adjusted charisma.
It is also possible the attracted persona may find something else to eat at the same time.
The attracted persona will hang around until they finally win their poison roll. 

Attraction odour should not result in a constant swarm of giant deadly fauna attacking the expedition.
The referee should play the mutation as an annoying inconvenience, with occasional episodes of violence.
It is also possible that nothing is nearby to be attracted to the mutant.
Attracted personas usually show up when they will complicate things the most.  

include::ROOT:partial$CH59_Table_Attraction_Odor.adoc[]

=== Arms 

[horizontal]
Range:: Fingertip
Duration:: Permanent
Frequency:: Constant
General Bonus:: Defect, DEX penalty

The mutant is now the proud owner of an extra 1-4 randomly moving arms.
The bonus arms are free willed and infuriating.
They follow their own volition and are not controlled by the mutant.
The arms may scratch the persona's ear, grapple her nose, make an obscene gestures or grab and drop items.
Binding down the arms is not work.
These defective arms will relentlessly struggle and exhaust the mutant.
All mutants with this defect are ambidextrous.

Arms is both an amusing and serious defective mutation.
Each extra arm has a penalty of -1 on the mutant's dexterity attribute.
A mutant with two extra arms and a 14 DEX would reduce her DEX to 12.
This penalty is the same regardless of the location of the extra arm.

include::ROOT:partial$CH59_Table_Extra_Arm_Location.adoc[]

Surgically removing the extra arms does not improve her confused dexterity attribute.
The mutation mental control over physical state will allow the mutant to control these autonomous arms.

=== Body Structure Change 

[horizontal]
Range:: Persona
Duration:: 1 Hour per Adjusted CON
Frequency:: 1 per 6 Adjusted CON
General Bonus:: +100 on disguise rolls

This mutant has complete control over her unusually pliable body.
The mutation body structure change comes with an additional layer of cosmetic musculature, flexible bones, and controllable connective tissue.
The mutant has complete control over the shape and location of her muscles, skin, bones, and internal organs.
She can adjust her appearance by altering her nose and changing her hair's length and colour. 
She can retract all her arms and limbs, turning into a ball-shaped thing.
She can restructure her internal organs to assist a veterinarian in surgery.

The mutant can adjust her hite but cannot alter her wate.
She cannot excise flesh through sheer will.
She cannot improve her attributes.
The mutant cannot compromise any essential anatomical parts.
She must retain a mouth to breathe and all those other essential holes.

Regardless of what she is restructuring, the process takes 1-4 minutes.
Swapping her arms and legs may take less time than slightly altering her nose.
The body structure change is gross to watch and quite noisy. 
While restructuring, the mutant becomes malleable and vulnerable.
Any damage inflicted on the malleable mutant is doubled. 
An attack that delivers four hit points of damage would inflict eight hit points of damage to the mutant.

When the mutation reaches the end of its duration, the persona rapidly returns to her previous state.
There is a 1% chance per hour in the restructured state that the mutant will stay in the new shape.
A mutant that changed her hair colour to blue for 5 hours has a 5% chance of being left with blue hair.

=== Carapace 

[horizontal]
Range:: Skin Deep
Duration:: Until Dead
Frequency:: Constant
General Bonus:: Special

The carapace is an unsightly buildup of thick semi-pliable skin.
The mutation offers a protective covering that reduces the damage and impairs appearance.
A carapace makes the mutant more challenging to hit and damage.
The thicker the carapace, the more defence is offered to the mutant.

The armour rating adjustment changes the mutant's base armour rating. 
With a partial carapace, the mutant's base AR would increase by 99.

A partial carapace has an armour rating adjustment of +99.
A mutant with a partial carapace would have a base AR of 599.
Beyond partial carapace, the mutant cannot wear any other armour.

If an attack roll is successful, the carapace will reduce the damage she takes.
The total carapace halves the damage from kinetic attacks.
If the mutant is supposed to take 12 HPS from a punch, it would only inflict 6 HPS.

Covering the mutant in a thick protective layer of crusty skin impairs the mutant's charisma and dexterity.
If the mutant has her carapace removed, her dexterity attribute will improve, but not her charisma.

Sometimes players want to grow their carapace, thickening it over time.
An easy way to manage this is to have the player record her initial carapace table roll.
The player adds +5 to the initial carapace roll for every new experience level.
The carapace will get thicker as the carapace table roll increases.

A mutant cannot thin her carapace over time.

include::ROOT:partial$CH59_Table_Carapace_Covering.adoc[]

=== Chameleon 

[horizontal]
Range:: Persona Only 
Duration:: As needed
Frequency:: As needed
General Bonus:: Combat Ratio +5, +25 on sneaky rolls

The mutant's skin has photodetector cells and chromocytes.
The combination of these two skin cells allows the mutant to blend into the surrounding environment.
Chameleon skin is continually attempting to conceal itself by matching the background.
This mutant's skin will even change colour to match the inside of her clothing.
Bare skin is constantly changing colour with this mutation.

The mutant must be naked to hide with her chameleon skin completely, 
The naked and still chameleon mutant can be very difficult to see.
The mutant is not invisible, but a persona must be actively searching for her to detect her.
When actively searching for a chameleon mutant, a persona must win an awareness roll to see her.
The mutant can move and remain hidden.
The slower and more tactically she moves, the harder she is to see. 

Chameleon cannot hide the mutant from non-visual sensors like radar, sonar, good ears or long noses.

=== Decoy 

[horizontal]
Range:: Special
Duration:: Not Applicable
Frequency:: Special
General Bonus:: None

The decoy is a detachable tail-like appendage that can be dropped by the mutant at will.
The decoy looks like a lump of succulent flesh attached to the mutant's hindquarters.
The decoy proves most useful when evading pursuit.
The mutant can drop the decoy at any time.
Dropping the decoy is not painful and does not harm the mutant.
If the decoy is already exposed, no time is lost dropping the meat chunk.

The decoy is a succulent treat for any lower intelligence personas chasing the mutant.
Any persona with intelligence less than 5 will automatically change course towards the dropped decoy.
The decoy does *not* attract any personas while attached to the mutant.
Personas pursuing the mutant with an INT greater than 5 get to make a poison roll to avoid being distracted by the decoy.
The intensity of the attraction is equal to the persona's charisma.
Any mutant chasing, or within range of chasing, the mutant must make the poison roll or chase the decoy.

Those that are affected by the aroma will become insatiably hungry and will devour the decoy madly.
It is not unknown for flora and fauna to fight each other over the tasty morsel.
Whoever gets to eat the decoy is in for a nasty surprise.

The ingested decoy is full of a killing poison.
The poison has an intensity level equal to half the mutant's physical strength.
The decoy diners will have to recover from the effects of poison.

The decoy will regenerate after one night's restful sleep.
When attached, the decoy is a part of the mutant's body.
Damage to the decoy damages the mutant as well.  
For the record, the decoy's wate is 3% of the mutant's wate. 
The wate of a decoy will almost always become an issue at some point during a game.

In social situations of great duress, the mutant's decoy may spontaneously drop from her body.

=== Density Control 

[horizontal]
Range:: Persona Only
Duration:: 1 minute per Adjusted CON
Frequency:: 1 minute per Adjusted PSTR
General Bonus:: +15 on wate related rolls

The mutant can equilibrate the density of her body to match that of the surfaces she is standing on.
Density matching is achieved through bladders that can fill with gas, liquid, or solids.
By manipulating these internal bellows, the mutant can alter her density.
The mutant may appear slightly larger and puffier, shorter and condensed, but her body shape does not radically change.

Density control lets the mutant match the density of liquids or gases, allowing her to walk on them without breaking the meniscus and sinking.
She could also increase her density to that of a solid surface, making her very difficult to displace or damage.
Once this equilibrium is reached, the mutant may move about freely upon the surface unless heat, cold or acidic properties can damage her.
This would allow the mutant to walk on water, stand on a cloud, or hunker down on a rock.
Density control does not allow the mutant to fly by walking on air. 
There must be some interface between the media for the mutant to alter her density.

Increasing density makes the mutant a bit smaller and stout looking.
The denser mutant reduces crushing and penetrating damage by half. 
There is no protection offered from energy attacks like lazers, fission or fusion. 
When density has been increased to prevent being moved, the mutant can double her PSTR for that specific attribute challenge.
She cannot push back at double her PSTR, but she can stand her ground. 
Increasing density decreases the mutant's movement rate by half.

Decreasing density makes the mutant look a bit larger and puffier.
The less-dense mutant reduces damage from crushing, falling and concussion attacks. 
The decrease in density allows the mutant to convert damage into translational motion.
In short, she flies away instead of being damaged. 
Whenever an attack roll is successful on the less dense mutant, the player will roll 1-6 (1d6).
The higher the number, the less damage that is inflicted and the further she flies.
The mutant reduces damage by 10% and flies one hex per point the 1d6 rolls.
If the player rolls a three, the persona's damage decreases by 30%, and she lands three hexes away.
Decreasing density has been used to get a persona across a crevasse.


=== Diminished Sense 

[horizontal]
Range:: Persona Only
Duration:: Until Dead
Frequency:: Constant
General Bonus:: Defect

WARNING: Some of these mutations are actual challenges in our terra mundane world.
The player should re-roll if this mutation causes duress for her.
We are hear to have fun. 
Don't be a jerk.  

Diminished senses are serious disabilities that the persona is challenged with.
Effective gaming with a diminished sense defect should be rewarded with large amounts of experience points.
The defects are difficult to role-play around, and the referee must be constantly aware of them.
Cures, or replacement parts for the persona should be one of a priority of one of the referee's earlier scenarios.
This mutation is a defect and does not count as a start up mutation.
The player receives another roll on the Physical Mutation Table.

include::ROOT:partial$Defect_Disclaimer.adoc[]

include::ROOT:partial$CH59_Table_Diminished_Sense.adoc[]

Sixth::
A diminished sixth sense prevents the mutant from connecting her consciousness to the Think Space.
This is both a defect and a blessing.
The mutant cannot have any mental mutations, and has no psionic abilities.
The mutant loses all existing mental mutations and cannot generate any further mental mutations. 
Since her interface between consciousness and the psionic realm is absent the mutant is immune to many mental mutations.
Those mental attacks that attack via the thinkspace will have no effect.
E.S.P., Mental Control, Hostility Field, and Sociability Field are examples.
Mutations that manipulate the environment around the mutant will have normal effect.
This includes mutations like Time Stop, Molecular Disruption and mental blast.
The persona's mental strength score is decreased by 2 points and her awareness score is decreased by 1 point.

Humour::
A diminished sense of humour keeps the mutant from making, understanding or reacting to humour.
Lacking a sense of humour is not about taste.
The mutant does not have a weird, dry, sarcastic, or sardonic sense of humour. 
This mutant does *not* have a sense of humour. 
The mutant may understand the concept, but exercising or understanding it not possible.
This persona's charisma score is reduced by 2 points.

Style::
A diminished sense of style makes the mutant completely unable to dress, design, or decorate in any way possible.
The mutant does not dress ironically, cutely or idiosynchratically.
The mutant dresses badly, inappropriately and somewhat offensively.
This makes the persona a tragic cook, painter, stylist, writer, and haute couture is incomprehensible.
This persona's charisma score is reduced by 1 point and her social standing is reduced by 30 percent.

Smell/Taste::
A diminished sense of smell and taste is not just about cooking and body odour.
The mutant is unable to detect noxious poisons, or smelly surprises.
This impairs the ability of the mutant to detect ambushes, personal body odour or the sulphur of a natural gas leak.
This defect does not affect a canine anthro's ability to detect radiation.
This persona suffers an awareness score reduction of 1. 

Hearing::
Hearing impairment is keeps the mutant from detecting any audio signals.
If this mutation is of concern to the player the referee should immediately allow a re-roll.
Outdated terms for hearing impairment includes deaf and hard of hearing.

This mutant automatically has a signing language.
She can teach her signing language to one expedition member per month of game time.
Sonic attacks will inflict one quarter damage to this mutant.
This persona's awareness score is reduced by 2 point.


Touch::
A diminished sense of touch impairs the tactile abilities of the mutant.
This is affects purely tactile receptors regarding touch. 
Other tactile receptors that allow the mutant to walk and swallow are unaffected.
A diminished sense of touch also decreases the mutant's perception of pain.
Damage that involves physical pain, which is most damage, is reduced by half.
The mutant will be bad a fine motor activity and hugs are not very effective.
The mutant's dexterity score is reduced by 2 points.

Sight::
Diminished sight impairs the mutant from detecting visual signals.
If this mutation is of concern to the player the referee should immediately allow a re-roll.

A blind mutant will have a limited echolocation ability that allows her to move very slowly and grasp nearby objects.
Even with this limited echolocation the mutant is unable to perceive light or any other visual input.
How does a player run a visually impaired persona?
Only a most experienced player should be given this mutation.  
Some groups have players with blinded personas face away from the gaming table. 
The mutant's awareness score is reduced by 4 points and her dexterity score is reduced by 2 points. 

=== Double Physical Pain 

[horizontal]
Range:: Persona Only
Duration:: Until Dead
Frequency:: Constant
General Bonus:: Defect

The mutant has no threshold for pain, and her pain receptors are hypersensitive.
Any pain based damage is increased by 2-8 (2d8) hit points.
Pharmaceuticals that relieve pain last half as long for this mutant.
Note that this mutant much resembles a hypochondriac.
This mutant heals twice as fast as other personas when recuperating.
Most personas heal one hit point each day. 
This mutant heals two hit points each day.

include::ROOT:partial$Defect_Disclaimer.adoc[]

=== Edible Tissue 

[horizontal]
Range:: Persona Only
Duration:: Until Dead
Frequency:: Special
General Bonus:: None

On this mutant's belly is a 4 cm thick buildup of nutritious and tasty regenerating flesh.
The flesh is a muscley, slightly denatured, and stocked with all the essential nutrients.
To sustain herself, the mutant tears strips of edible tissue off her belly.
Each strip is a yummy snack. 
The edible tissue supplies a day's food for the mutant.
The tissue is inedible to other personas and tastes repulsive.

The edible tissue grows back after a restful night's sleep. 
Mutant must keep hydrated (drink water) and expose her edible tissue to light during the daytime. 
The mutant can still eat and enjoys regular food. 

=== Electric Shock 

[horizontal]
Range:: 1/2h per Adjusted PSTR
Duration:: Not Applicable
Frequency:: Alternating Units
General Bonus:: Combat Ratio +4, +13 on resuscitation rolls

A series of organs found in this mutant's torso generate and store a powerful electric current.
This stored electric charge can be conducted down the mutant's limbs and delivered to an opponent.
The mutant can either touch her target or arc the current through air.
Both attacks create bright blue sparks and make a crackling noise.

The touch attack delivers more damage to the target. 
If her attack roll is successful, the shock touch delivers 7-16 (1d10+6) HPS of damage plus one hit point per EXPS level.
Conductive armour gives the mutant an attack roll bonus of +100.

The ranged attack is convenient but delivers less damage to the target.
If her attack roll is successful, the shock bolt delivers 3-12 (3d4) hit points of damage plus one hit point per EXPS level.
A 4th level mutant with a 10 PSTR could launch a lightning bolt seven hexes and inflict 7 to 16 hit points of damage.

Robots usually take double damage from electrical attacks. 

Both the ranged and the touch electric shock are type C attacks. 
They inflict damage without physical effort by the persona.
The current generating organs need time to recharge.
An electric shock can attack every other unit.

The current generating organs can also absorb electric shock attacks directed at the mutant.
Electricity based attacks inflict half damage on this mutant.

===  Enthalpy Attack. 

[horizontal]
Range:: 1h per Adjusted PSTR
Duration:: Not Applicable
Frequency:: Alternating Units
General Bonus:: Combat Ratio +3

Her vascular system forces the briny blood to the surface of her skin, where sweaty evaporation cools it.
The mutant has a cold body, and being beside her is like being beside an air conditioner on full blast.
The mutant cools anything within a one hex radius.
A mutant with enthalpy attack prefers warmer climates, but is not bothered by cold environments.

The mutant can also unleash a blast of freezing cold air.
Icicles and hail often accompany this freezing breath attack.
If the player makes a successful attack roll, the enthalpy attack inflicts 2 to 16 (2d8) HPS of damage, plus one hit point per Experience Level.
The air conditioning is constant, but the breath attack needs one unit of rest.

Fire and heat-based attacks have their damage reduced for this mutant.
The mutant's cold production counters the effect of flame and heat attacks.
Cold based attacks inflict normal damage on a mutant with this mutation.

=== Fat Cell Accumulation 

[horizontal]
Range:: Persona Only
Duration:: Until Dead
Frequency:: Constant
General Bonus:: Defect, Combat Ratio *0.9

This mutation causes an increase in fat cells' number and size in a specific location on the body (it's not a malignant tumour).
The blob of fat will always be harmless, noticeable, and embarrassing.
If surgically removed, it will aggressively grow back in one to four (1-4) days.
The growth has a CHA penalty of minus 0 to 3 (d4-1) points, but no other penalties can apply.
If the fat cell accumulation is on the mutant's face, they will not suffer any AWE penalty or attack roll penalty.

include::ROOT:partial$CH59_Table_Fat_Cell_Accumulation.adoc[]

include::ROOT:partial$Defect_Disclaimer.adoc[]

=== Gas Generation 

[horizontal]
Range:: Up to 5h radius
Duration:: 0-3 (1d4-1) units
Frequency:: 1 per 5 Adjusted CON
General Bonus:: Combat Ratio *3

This mutant can release a noxious spume of gas from her mouth or some other orifice.
The mutant is impervious to her generated gas type.
The poison gas intensity is equal to half the persona's constitution score, plus one per Level.
A 3rd level mutant with a 14 CON would exhale intensity ten poison gas.
Under extreme duress conditions, or after consuming certain foods, the mutant may release gas unintentionally.

The descriptions below all suggest the gas is green in colour.
The player can choose any noticeable cloud colour they like.
This mutation cannot generate invisible or undetectable gas, and where the gas emits from is obvious.
If you need a random xref:iv-software:CH55_Appearances.adoc#_colour_your_whirled[Colour,window=_blank].

include::ROOT:partial$CH59_Table_Poison_Gas_Type.adoc[]

Death::
This mutant releases a highly toxic green cloud of death.
All organic personas within the area of effect must make a poison roll.
Targets that lose their poison roll take 1-4 (1d4) hit points per level of intensity of the poison.

Intensity 10 killing poison would inflict 10-14 (10d4) hit points of damage. 

Nausea::
This mutant releases a highly toxic green cloud of vomit-inducing stench.
All organic personas within the area of effect must make a poison roll.
Targets that lose their poison roll immediately start retching with a ferocity that incapacitates them.
Targets that win their poison roll are also retching but can still run from the cloud.
Incapacitated targets are defenceless for 1 unit per level of intensity of the attack.
Intensity level 10 nausea poison would incapacitate the targets for ten units.

Paralysis::
This mutant releases a highly toxic green cloud of paralyzing gas.
All organic personas within the area of effect must make a poison roll.
Targets that lose their poison roll suffer muscle weakness that paralyzes them.
Targets that win their poison roll can crawl at one h/u.

Pharmaceutical Effect::
This mutant releases a green cloud with a pharma effect.
All organic personas within the area of effect must make a poison roll.
Targets that lose their poison roll are affected by the pharma.
Targets that win their poison roll are unaffected by the pharma.
Beneficial pharma is ineffective if the target wins her poison roll.
The pharma is also ineffective on the mutant spewing it out.
The duration of effect is determined by the xref:iii-hardware:CH50_Pharmaceuticals.adoc[Pharma,window=_blank]. 

Unconsciousness::
This mutant releases a highly toxic green cloud of unconscious gas.
All organic personas within the area of effect must make a poison roll.
Targets that lose their poison roll fall unconscious immediately.
Targets that win their poison roll may escape the gas cloud.
A poison roll must be made every unit the target is within the gas cloud.
Targets remain unconscious for 1 minute per level of intensity of the attack.

=== Haste

Maneuvers can be completed in half the time with no penalty on performance.
The persona doubles her movement rate with no increased risk of crashing.
If the weapon is capable of doing so, the mutant can double her attack rolls per unit.
Once begun, the mutant cannot stop haste, and all activity will be done in double time, or not at all.
The mutant also burns through pharmaceuticals at double speed when haste is activated.

The mutant cannot use haste continuously, or she would die from using up essential nutrients.
A bout of haste requires 1 hour of intentional rest or  2 hours of unrestful exertion.
Haste does not work if the mutant is over-encumbered.


=== Heat Generation 

[horizontal]
Range:: 1 per Adjusted CON
Duration:: Constant
Frequency:: Alternating Units
General Bonus:: Combat Ratio +10

Heat generation arises from a dangerously overactive metabolism. 
This mutant amplifies any process that generates heat. 
Her body captures the excess energy from cellular chemical reactions and turns it into body heat.
The mutant is an organic space heater.
The mutant keeps anything within a one hex radius toasty warm.

The heat generation is constant.
The mutant's body temperature is much higher than usual.
The mutant is not bothered by hot temperatures but prefers to reside in colder climates. 
The increased heat signature makes the mutant stand out to thermal detectors. 

During the heat of battle, this mutant can launch searing blasts of superheated air. 
Flammable objects will catch fire for cosmetic and descriptive purposes. 

Heat attack is a type C attack.
A successful attack roll is required to inflict damage.
The damage delivered by the heath attack is 3-18 (3d6) hit points of damage, plus one hit point per EXPS Level.
The attack requires one unit to recover.

Cold and cold-based attacks have their damage reduced for this mutant.
The mutant's heat production counters the effect of cold attacks.
Heat based attacks inflict typical damage on a mutant with heat generation.


=== Heightened Attribute 

[horizontal]
Range:: Persona Only
Duration:: Constant
Frequency:: As Needed
General Bonus:: Special

Heightened attribute pushes one of the mutant's physical dimensions into the stratosphere.
This mutation transforms the mutant's body to reflect the heightened attribute.

include::ROOT:partial$CH59_Table_Heightened_Attribute.adoc[]

Awareness::
The awareness attribute determines how well the mutant's consciousness interfaces with her environment.
The mutant has oversized ears, big bulging eyes, a long nose, an extremely sensitive palate, and a very delicate sense of touch.
This mutation increases the mutant's awareness by 2-8 (2d4) points, and her AWE cannot be less than 15.
Also, she earns a bonus of +30 on any awareness related rolls and tripled AWE when trying to detect an ambush.
The mutant's Combat Ratio is increased by +4.

Charisma::
Heightened charisma is not just beauty but includes persuasiveness, sociability and leadership.
The mutant automatically adjusts her facial structure, hair length, and posture to optimize her charisma for each situation.
If she wishes to be alluring, her pupils will dilate, her hair will lengthen, and her voice will change.
If she needs to work up a crowd into a frenzy, her posture will be erect, her face will harden, her hair will shorten, and her voice will deepen.
This mutation offers a permanent charisma bonus of 2 to 8 (2d8) points, and her CHA cannot be less than 15.
She also has a bonus of +30 on any charisma related rolls and a tripled CHA during negotiation rolls.

The player must re-roll her persona's hit points, using her new CON, or add hit points based on the additional CON.
The hit point value cannot decrease when being changed by a heightened constitution.

This mutant is more resilient to poisons as well. 
If the player wins her poison roll, the toxin does not affect the mutant. 
Often winning a poison roll will half the damage or reduce the effect of the poison.
With the heightened constitution, the mutant will not affect with a poison roll win.
The mutant's Combat Ratio is increased by +8.

Dexterity::
This mutant's neurologic system is supercharged with extra nerves and specialized spinal cord pre-processing.
Heightened dexterity allows the mutant to carry out incredible feats of balance, agility and speed.
Under normal circumstances, this mutant will not trip, fall, stagger.
Walking on ice is no challenge for this mutant.
This mutation gives a permanent dexterity bonus of 2 to 8 (2d8) points, and her DEX cannot be less than 15.
The persona's movement rate should increase accordingly.
She will also earn a bonus of +30 on any dexterity related rolls and tripled DEX during attribute rolls.
The mutant's Combat Ratio is increased by +4.

Intelligence::
This mutant's brain is physically different from that of other personas.
Her skull is enlarged to accommodate the densely packed blob of neurons.
Not only is the mutant's head more massive than usual, her head sports cooling gills for the heat produced by the overactive brain.
When she concentrates on a cerebral topic, her head may hum from increased blood flow.
This mutation offers a permanent intelligence bonus of 2 to 8 (2d8) points, and her INT cannot be less than 15.
The mutant has a bonus of +30 on any intelligence-related rolls and tripled INT during attribute rolls.
The mutant's Combat Ratio is increased by +4.

Physical Strength::
This mutant has more muscles than usual, and the extra muscles are bigger and better ones. 
The muscle fibres are larger and more densely packed with the essential chemicals of contraction.
The mutant has additional new muscles that improve leverage and definition.
This mutation offers a permanent PSTR bonus of 2 to 8 (2d8) points, and her PSTR cannot be less than 15.
When making PSTR related attribute rolls the mutants, PSTR is tripled.
The mutant's Combat Ratio is increased by +4.

Hit Points::
This mutant's body is hardened to all manner of damage.
Her blood clots faster, her arteries can seal off, and create alternate pathways.
Her bones are more robust, and her muscles can absorb shock better than average.
In general, this mutant will look solid and tough.
This mutation offers a permanent hit point increase of 20% to 80% (2d4 times 10%), and her HPS Max cannot be less than 60.
This mutant will heal twice as fast as other mutants and doubles her HPS when making a recovery or damage system shock roll.
The mutant's Combat Ratio is increased by +8.

=== Heightened Vision 

[horizontal]
Range:: Special
Duration:: Until Dead
Frequency:: As Needed
General Bonus:: None 

Heightened vision adds an exotic vision type to the mutant's regular optical sensors.
The mutant may switch between either vision type as needed.

include::ROOT:partial$CH59_Table_Heightened_Vision.adoc[]

Betty Davis::
Betty Davis eyes will tease and unease personas around the mutant.
The player must roll dice when using this mutation.
Other personas will think the mutant is a spie.
These eyes can expose things but make vision snowy.
You cannot roll Betty Davis Eyes on the Heightened Vision table. 

Infravision::
Infravision discerns thermal irregularities allowing the mutant to see in darkness.
This heightened vision is not as detailed as the mutant's mundane vision.
For example, the mutant cannot separate objects with equal temperature.
The mutant could easily see a computer monitor in the dark but could not read the monitor's text.
The range of this heightened vision is equal to the mutant's doubled awareness.
If the mutant already has infravision, the player can roll again or combine the two infravision ranges.
Eyes endowed with infravision are highly reflective, like feline eyes.  

Microscopic::
Microscopic vision allows the mutant to magnify her visual field up to 1000 times.
To microscopically inspect an object, it must be right under the mutant's beak.
The mutant enjoys +30 on any rolls that would benefit from the microscopic inspection.
As the mutant zooms in, her eyes bulge from her face, and her lenses make clicking noises.

Mist Cutting::
Mist cutting allows the mutant to see through particulate matter that would usually obscure her vision.
Mist cutting sees through smoke, fog, dust, hail, or rain.
The mutant suffers no attack roll penalties in fog, rain, or smoke.
When using the mist cutting, a secondary set of translucent eyelids rapidly open and close horizontally.  

Semicircular::
Semicircular vision widens the mutant's visual field to nearly 270 degrees.
This expanded field of vision makes the mutant challenging to ambush.
The mutant doubles her awareness when detecting an ambush.
She can also laterally attack without turning her body. 
This mutant's eyes are enormous and sit closer to her ears than her nose. 

Telescopic::
The mutant can easily discern text at great distances.
The mutant's heightened vision has a range of 10 hexes per point of adjusted AWE.
So a second level mutant with a 12 AWE could easily discern letters at 14 hexes. 
When using her telescopic eyes, the mutant has +100 on sniping attack rolls.
The mutant cannot use the telescopic vision with scopes or visual aids.
This mutant's tube-like eyes stick out past her nose.
Her eyes make a sucking noise as they continually lengthen and shorten.

Ultravision::
Ultravision adds the ultraviolet spectrum to her visual perception.
This mutation gives the mutant equal night and day vision.
At close range, she can visualize the activity of electronic circuitry.
Ultravision gives the mutant a bonus of +15 on any electronic related rolls.
The mutant's eyes glow bright red in both darkness and daylight.

X-Ray::
X-Ray vision employs radioactive beams that penetrate otherwise opaque materials.
The range of x-ray vision is one hex per 8 points of adjusted awareness.
The mutant can look at bones through flesh, look through concrete walls, and find weapons at a glance.
The mutant cannot see through metal, discern text on a page, or read a computer monitor.
Using X-ray vision adds +30 to any rolls that would benefit from an x-ray view. 
X-Ray eyes are dangerous and radioactive, and using them counts as a radiation attack.
The intensity of the attack is equal to the range of the mutant's X-ray vision.
The flesh around this mutant's eyes is thickened and leathery, and her eyeballs are black.

=== Launchable Quills 

[horizontal]
Range:: 1h per Adjusted PSTR
Duration:: Special
Frequency:: Special
General Bonus:: Special

The mutant has up to a dozen launchable quills hanging from her chest. 
In the resting position, the quills hide easily under clothing and armour.
When activated, the quills elevate into a launching position. 
Restrictive armour and clothing prevent the launching of the quills.

The mutant will have 2-12 (2d6) quills growing from the center of her torso.
The quills clump together and fire as a salvo.
There is a small chance that the quills will have poison.
The percent chance of having poisonous launchable quills is equal to the mutant's constitution. 
A mutant with a 14 CON has a 14% chance of having poisonous quills.

The mutant launches the quills by muscular contraction and compressed gas. 
Launchable quills are attack type B.
The mutant launches all her quills at once, and a successful attack roll inflicts 1-8 (1d8) per quill launched.
A mutant that launches six quills would inflict 6d8 damage plus her type B Damage Adjustment.
Launchable quills can be a fearsome attack with or without poison.
For poisonous quills, the target must win a poison roll or take killing damage.
The poison intensity is equal to the mutant's constitution score.

The mutant can hold back one quill per EXPS Level.
A 3rd Level mutant with six quills could launch all six at once, three and then three, etc.
There is no difference between the intensity of poison or Type B Damage Adjustment made by different sized salvos.

Launchable quills increase the persona's combat ratio by +3.
If the quills are poisonous, the combat ratio triples.

=== Light Generation 

[horizontal]
Range:: 1h per Adjusted CHA
Duration:: Special
Frequency:: 1 per 4 Adjusted CON
General Bonus:: Combat Ratio *2

This mutant is in a symbiotic relationship with subdermal light-emitting organisms.
The mutant's nervous system releases chemicals that excite or depress the colonies of glowing organisms.
The mutant controls how she emits the light from her body.

.*Steady Glow*
The mutant glows steadily. 
She can change the colour and brightness for convenience or mood.
With regular skin exposure and clothing, she can light up the adjacent hex around her. 
The mutant can run dark in cases of emergency.
The symbiotic relationship between the mutant and organisms requires them to glow for the wellbeing of them both.

.*Flashlight*
The mutant can organize the organisms to locate in a specific part of her body, and she can emit a beam of light from there.
The flashlight is often the mutant's forehead, but sometimes the palm or knee has been used.
If desired, the mutant can project a beam emitting from her forehead, extending straight ahead for one hex per point of adjusted PSTR.
The mutant can produce the flashlight as needed.

NOTE: This mutation variation was previously called "fleshlight." The adult toy market now has this moniker firmly in its grip.

.*Flash Attack*
The mutant can excite the glowing organisms to emit a violent blast of blinding light.
The bolt shoots from the mutant's eyes.
The flash attack is exhausting for the symbiotes, and the mutant can barely glow until they have recuperated. 

The target must win an awareness roll or be temporarily blinded.
The intensity of the attack is equal to the mutant's charisma attribute.
Blindness will last 1 to 6 minutes (30 units per minute).
If she wins the awareness roll, she will suffer blurry vision for 2-20 (2d10) units.
Targets with blurred vision have tearing eyes, light sensitivity, and can barely function.
Targets with blurred vision suffer -200 on attack rolls, -200 on AR, +8DD performance rolls, half movement, etc.

=== Mechanical Insertion 

[horizontal]
Range:: Special
Duration:: As Needed
Frequency:: As Needed
General Bonus:: Special

Sometime, somewhere, somehow, this mutant's body became integrated with an inorganic device.
The device is part of the mutant's nervous system, immune system and skeleton.
The mechanical device gets its energy requirements from the mutant.
If the mutant has a built-in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videocassette_recorder/[VCR] she has complete control over it.
All the recorder's features record, rewind, forward, eject, etc., are as easily controlled as any other bodily function.

Typically the mutant has no idea how the insertion became part of her.
Was it the work of an insane veterinarian or mechanic?
Did she fall on it when she was a child? 
Did her mother swallow the device during pregnancy?

Mechanical insertion should only include useful functioning devices. 
Hardware like treasure or random junque is not appropriate.
Mechanical insertion should only include devices that fit inside the mutant.
Any hardware greater than 10% of the mutant's wate is not appropriate.
The players should balance the randomness of the TOY system and the usefulness of the device.
A player persona with a fusion grenade in there head is funny but should not count as a physical mutation.

For experienced players embracing the randomness of TOYS can be a lot of fun.
If a persona's mechanical insertion were a spaceship, a vehicle, a combot or an artillery piece, she would become a vital part of the campaign.

=== Mechanical Prosthesis 

[horizontal]
Range:: Persona Only
Duration:: Until Removed
Frequency:: Constant
General Bonus:: Defect, Combat Ratio halved

Somewhere along the line, fate led to replacing one or more of the mutant's limbs with blatantly defective mechanical devices.
Scraping metal levers and gears wind into the mutant's nerves and muscles.
A prosthesis is subject to rust, and malfunctions, and breakdowns.
Damage to the mechanical prosthesis does not harm the mutant but could lead to its malfunction.
The chance of malfunction is determined by xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH16_Special_Rolls_Asshole.adoc[Sphincter Dice,window=_blank].
The referee may check for malfunction monthly or when the prosthesis takes damage in combat.
A prosthesis does not alter the mutant's WATE or attributes. 
As much of a noisy hassle, the mechanical prosthesis represents it is better than no limb at all. 

WARNING: Some of these mutations are actual challenges in our terra mundane world.
The player should re-roll if this mutation causes duress.

include::ROOT:partial$Defect_Disclaimer.adoc[]

include::ROOT:partial$CH59_Table_Mechanical_Prosthesis_Type.adoc[]

=== Mitosis 

[horizontal]
Range:: Persona Only
Duration:: Special
Frequency:: As needed
General Bonus:: Combat Ratio +3

Mitosis allows the mutant to replace damaged or missing tissues and organs.
The mutant will rapidly grow back a missing limb, regenerate a stolen liver, and smooth over scars.
The mitosis mutation is not a form of reproduction but rapid tissue replication and regeneration.
Mitosis will replace any body part provided that the mutant is not dead.

This mutation does not heal hit points for the mutant, but it does arrest ongoing damage.
Mitosis counters any protracted damage like ongoing poison effects, acid burning, or radiation roasting.
For example, an acid blast that initially inflicts 15 hit points of damage would inflict no further damage.

Mitotic regeneration of organs and limbs starts immediately. 
Within a few hours, a nub of tissue will appear.
After two restful nights of sleep, the mitotic regeneration will be complete.
Mitosis will not finish until the mutant completes the second restful sleep. 

The mutant does not age beyond her start age. 
Mitosis does not make her immortal, and if the mutant takes enough damage at once, she will die.

=== Multiple Body Parts 

[horizontal]
Range:: Persona Only
Duration:: Until Dead
Frequency:: Constant
General Bonus:: Special

Multiple body parts is a genetic phenomenon that can be helpful or harmful to the mutant.
Some of the extra body parts will be entirely under the mutant's control.
Some of the extra body parts are nothing but malformed cosmetic reproductions.

include::ROOT:partial$CH59_Table_Multiple_Body_Parts.adoc[]

Arms::
The mutant has 1-4 (1d4) extra arms protruding from her torso.
The alignment of the arms will always be symmetrical.
The extra arms are fully functional arms that the mutant can use.
The mutant can use the arm to assist with maneuvers or combat.
Extra attack rolls depend on the attack type. 
If the mutant has four arms, she may use two rifles. 
If the mutant has three arms, she may use one rifle and one pistol.

Ears::
The mutant has 1-6 (1d6) extra ears sprouting from her head.
Half the ears are fully functional, and half are cosmetic oddities.
Extra ears number one, three and five are fully functional ears.
Each fully functional ear adds one to the mutant's awareness.
If there is an odd number of ears, the mutant subtracts two from her charisma.
Extra ears number two, four and six are cosmetic oddities. 

Eyes::
The mutant has 1-6 (1d6) extra eyes embedded in her braincase.
Half the eyes are fully functional, and half are cosmetic oddities.
Extra eyes one, three and five are fully functional eyes.
Each fully functional eye adds one to the mutant's awareness.
Extra eyes two, four and six are blind cosmetic oddities. 

Feet/Toes::
The player chooses whether the mutant has either extra toes or extra feet.
The mutant will have either an extra foot at the end of each leg or 1-3 (1d3) extra toes.
These extra parts frustrate her haberdasher, but otherwise, neither harm nor help the mutant.
While not a defect, the player should roll another multiple body part or an entirely new mutation.

Hands/Fingers::
The player chooses whether the mutant has either extra fingers or extra hands.
The mutant will have either an extra hand at the end of each arm or 1-3 (1d3) extra fingers.
These extra parts frustrate her haberdasher, but otherwise, neither harm nor help the mutant.
While not a defect, the player should roll another multiple body part or an entirely new mutation.

Head::
The mutant has a semi-autonomous, diminutive, wrinkled head attached to her regular head.
The extra head will mimic the mutant's facial expressions and occasionally betrays her emotions.
Hiding the extra head is not possible.
If the mutant tries to hide her extra head, it will start to gasp and snuffle.
The unseemly disconcerting head decreases the mutant's charisma by four points. 
This mutation variation is a defect and does not count as a start-up mutation.
The player should roll again on the Physical Mutations Table or the Multiple Body Parts Table.

Legs::
The mutant has 1-6 (1d6) extra legs attached to her torso.
The alignment of the legs will always be symmetrical.
The extra legs are fully functional and help the mutant move faster.
Each extra leg increases the mutant's movement rate by 20%
Thus a mutant with five extra legs would double her movement rate.

Mouths::
The mutant has 1 to 4 (1d4) extra mouths.
The mouths are smaller, malformed, craggily toothed, fully functional mouths.
The extra mouths can be in synch or out of synch with the mutant's cakehole.
The extra mouths can drool, chew, spit and eject vomit, but they do not talk.
There is a CHA penalty of -1 per extra mouth.
This mutation variant is a defect and does not count as a start-up mutation.
The player should roll again on the Physical Mutations Table or the Multiple Body Parts Table.

Noses::
The mutant has 1-8 (1d8) extra noses.
The extra noses are unappealing growths of flesh and cartilage.
The noses dribble mucous and are continually sniffling.
The mutant needs to cover every nose when she sneezes. 
This mutation variant is a defect and does not count as a start-up mutation.
The player should roll again on the Physical Mutations Table or the Multiple Body Parts Table.

=== New Organ 

[horizontal]
Range:: Persona Only
Duration:: Until Dead
Frequency:: Constant
General Bonus:: Special

This mutant has a specialized new organ that carries out some peculiar process.
The new organ is not essential to the mutant's life.
Unless specified otherwise, the mutations can be used as often as needed.

include::ROOT:partial$CH59_Table_New_Organ_Type.adoc[]

Air Producing::
This enormous gland is located within the torso of the mutant and it digests food to produce oxygen and nitrogen.
The gases collect in the mutant's esophagus.
She  burps into her mouth where she inhales.
The mutant can breathe underwater with ease, hold her breath indefinitely, and kiss for hours.
The mutant is unaffected by inhaled poisons.
Air production increases the mutant's Combat Ratio by +2

Blood Absorbing::
This consists of an external blood sucking tentacle, and an internal blood filtering organ.
The large tentacle burrows to a major artery, injects anticoagulants, and aggressively pumps blood from the target.
The organ will drain 1 to 6 (d6) hit points worth of blood per experience level each unit that the blood draining tentacle is attached.
A 4th level mutant would dratn 4d6 worth of vital juices from her target each unit that the blood draining organ remains attached.
This attack increases the mutant's CR by 3.

A target will definitely be aware that the tentacle is attached, and she will make every effort to detach it.
A successful PSTR challenge will pull the tube out.
The tube can withstand 20% of the mutant's hit points maximum, before being knocked off the target.
If the tube goes to a negative total greater than 20% of the mutant's hit point maximum the tube has been severed.
For instance, if the mutant had 40 hit points, her tube could withstand 8 HPS before being knocked off the target.
If it were reduced to -8 HPS in one attack, the tube would be severed.
A severed blood tube will grow back in 1 to 6 months.
The blood draining tube cannot reach out of the mutant's hex.

Blood Producing::
Normally this mutation will be a blood producing organ that supplements the mutant's blood supply in case of injury.
The mutant will not not suffer damage from prolonged bleeding effects, nor will she have any problem with donating many times her total blood volume every day.
The organ is very sensitive, and will not aggravate internal injuries by pumping liters of blood into the persona's abdomen or skull.
The extra supply of blood keeps the persona from going into shock, easier to perform vet PT rolls on, and harder to knock unconscious.
The player doubles her persona's hit points when making a DSS roll, loses half as many hit points per turn when comatose, and gives vets a +15 PT roll bonus when working on her.
For more information about damage and healing refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=267[Chapter 13: Health].

Electricity Storage::
This mutant has an organic rechargeable battery as her new organ.
The mutant can charge up this organ by draining small power cells.
The mutant can then recharge another power cell with the electricity stored in her organ.
The mutant can store a number of cells equal to her CON.

If the mutant has stored her maximum number of cells she can release all the energy at once in an electrical attack.
The attack will inflict a 1d8 per experience level of the mutant, and has a range of 1 hex.
A fully charge mutant will increase her CR by 1.

Gas Absorbing::
The gas absorbing organ sits in the mouth and nose of the persona.
It will grow to cover the lower half of the mutant's face when activated.
The mutation is sometimes called an air liver because it filters anything airborne before it gets inside the mutant.
This makes her immune to most diseases, and very hardy against poisoned gases The mutant receives +5 on her saving throw against any gas attack, and is unaffected by those gases that must be inhaled.
If there is a dispute over whether a gas needs be inhaled or not the referee should consult the http://expgame.com/?page_id=275sphincter-dice[sphincter dice].
The organ also helps draw air out of the environment, and low oxygen atmospheres affect this mutant very little.
This mutation increases the mutant's CR by 2.

Ink Producing::
This organ produces an enormous supply of fine black ink.
The gland opens on to the mutant's skin via a sphinkter in which she can clip a quill pen, and write until she dies of old age.

The ink can also be violently ejected in a liquid environment as a distracting screen (6 hexes by 9 hexes).
The screen will dissipate in 3 to 30 units.
The mutant can also spray her ink jet on land as a blinding attack against a single target.
The land attack has a range of 6 hexes, and a poison intensity (blinding), equal to half the attacker's CON.
The mutant will always have enough ink to write with, but can only eject it once a day per 4 points of adjusted CON.
This mutation increases the mutant's CR by 2.

Iron Stomach::
This mutation is a two for one.
The mutant has a stomach that can digest anything that it encounters.
This includes metals, alloys, glass, toxins, plastics, and organic compounds.
The mutant will have an appropriately fortified mouth and esophagus to go with it.
The only complication is that this mutant also automatically has the mutation http://expgame.com/?page_id=36621-increased-metabolism[21) Increased M]http://expgame.com/?page_id=36621-increased-metabolism[etabolism].
The mutant will be constantly hungry, and may have difficulties to keep from eating computer parts and other essential artifacts.
Ingested poisons will have no effect on the mutant.

Light Emitting::
A light emitting organ will continually carry out chemical reactions that produce light.
The organ can produce a radius of effect equal to 1 hex per experience level.

There is a 20% chance that the mutant has a light absorbing organ instead.
This amazing mutation absorbs ambient light, but has no effect on lazers, and other organized light sources.
This creates a blob of darkness around the mutant that grows by one hex per experience level.
The amount of darkness can be controlled by the mutant, and gives her a bonus of +15 on sneaky PT rolls in the dark.

Mental Attack Absorbing::
This protective organ absorbs those waveforms which travel from thinkspace to thinkspace.
This has the effect of absorbing mental attacks against the mutant's thinkspace.[.Apple-converted-space]  The organ is reflected in a doubled MSTR when saving against a mental attack.
This organ is not intelligent, and will also interfere with beneficial mental mutation effects.
The mutation has no effect on those attacks which manipulate the environment around the target.
This mutation increases the mutant's CR by 4.

Plastics Producing::
A plastic producing organ will allow the mutant to ooze plastic from some embarrassingly located orifice.
The plastic is malleable, warm and quick drying.
The plastic can come in any desired color, although once chosen, the colour cannot be changed.
The mutant can produce 1/10 of her body wate in plastic each day.

There is a 30% chance that this mutant will have glands that produce enzymes capable of destroying any plastic that it eats or licks.
It allows the mutant to damage plastic equipment, and eat plastic as a food source.

Poison Producing::
Coursing throughout this mutant's body, and secreted through the pores on her skin is a naturally produced killing poison.
This poison has a random intensity of 3 to 12 (3d4), plus one point per level of experience.
Any close physical contact like a hug, punch, or kiss will subject the victim to a killing poison attack.
Veterinarians must take extra precautions when working on these mutants to avoid a poison attack.
This mutation increases the mutant's CR by 3.

Pus Producing::
This lucky mutant has a gland that keeps to its constant task of spilling out pus, scum, cur, dregs or any other frothy grossness that the referee can imagine.
The randomly located opening cannot be plugged, or sewn shut, This mutation does not count as a start up mutation, and the player should receive another roll on the Physical Mutation Table.

== 29) Non Breathing 

// insert table 926

This mutant does not have to exchange gases in order to respire.
The mutant does not require light nor any particular ambient environmental factor in order to carry out her life processes.
The mutant does have to consume food, and larger than normal amounts of water.
At least 5 liters of water a day is needed to supply the mutant's biochemical reactions.
The mutant carries out all other biochemical processes that her race would, except that she does not breath.
Digestion is normal, blood is needed to carry nutrients and waste products around.
The mutant earns a +4 bonus to save on gas attacks that involve inhaled poisons.

== 30) No Resistance To Disease 

// insert table 927

Sadly this mutant is subject to who knows what diseases, and even has the pleasure of starting the campaign with one chronic non-terminal disease.
This mutant is three times as susceptible to diseases as other personas.
This disability cannot be rolled again, and it does not count as a start up mutation.

== 31) No Resistance To Poison 

// insert table 928

This mutant now has an effective resistance to poison of 0 to 3 (d4-1).
This means that when saving against poison she cannot use her CON for defence, but must use this random die roll.
Any bonuses that would normally be added to her saving throw still apply.
Pharmaceuticals that are imbibed have double effect, but the chance of side effects are tripled.
This disability cannot be rolled again, and it does not count as a start up mutation.

== 32) Oversized Body Parts 

// insert table 929

This mutation involves grossly oversized body parts that benefit the mutant in some manner.
The player makes a roll on Table 59.16: Oversized Body Parts.
The referee should keep in mind that the oversized body body parts will cause trouble for the mutant in the areas of clothing, armour, and public comments.

// insert table 930

== 33) Photosynthetic Skin 

// insert table 931

This mutant has light green, hairless, almost translucent skin.
The chloroplasts in her skin can act as a supplementary source of energy.
When her skin is exposed to the sun, she need not eat or breath, but she must continue to consume water at her normal rate.
While using photosynthesis the mutant can wear no covering what so ever, and she cannot photosynthesize in darkness, or artificial light.
If the conditions are right for photosynthesis the mutant will suffer no damage from bleeding, and she will heal five times faster than normal.
Damage from cold or heat based attacks add 1/2 damage if the mutant is using her photosynthesis.

== 34) Phosphorescent Skin 

// insert table 932

Through the production °flight retaining materials in the skin, this mutant continually glows some unique colour.
The light produced is barely enough to read by, but it is sufficient enough to be easily seen at night.
The mutant also registers as a radiation anomaly.

== 35) Poor Respiratory System 

// insert table 933

All the essential components of this mutant's respiratory system are substandard.
Her lungs are undersized, her blood is lacking in transport molecules, and gas exchange is bad at the tissues.
In general she will tire sooner in any endurance activities.
She immediately suffers a penalty of -1 on her CON+++<b>+++, +++</b>+++and -2 to on all saving throws versus poison.
This mutation is a defect and does not count as a start up mutation.
The player should make another roll on the Physical Mutations Table.

== 36) Pockets 

// insert table 934

This odd mutation consists of pockets or openings that can be covered by exterior flesh.
The mutant can manipulate the location, size and shape of the pockets on her body.
If she wants a big pocket on her tummy like a marsupial pouch, she can do so.
If she wants a dozen pockets all over her body she can dissipate the large one, and move the openings all over her body.
Each fleshy covering will create an airtight seal which can hold up to 2% of the mutant's body wate.
The total amount of stuff concealed in the mutant's body cannot exceed 5% of her body wate.

== 37) Pressurized Body 

// insert table 935

Throughout the mutant's body are organs that contain pressurized gases.
The mutant can release these gases into specialized cavities in her body, and puff out like a puffer fish.
Between this and her thick resilient skin the mutant can increase the pressure of her body to many time that of normal.

When in the pressurized state the mutant can fall a distance of 1 hex per adjusted PSTR without taking any damage.
If she falls from a height greater than her PSTR in hexes she will only take a d4 in damage per 2 hexes of distance.
All damage taken from force attacks (explosions, swords, rocks, car accidents) will be halved.
The mutant is unaffected by the pressure changes of decreased atmosphere, although she still must find some way to get air.

While pressurized there is a 1/1000 (1 per kilo die) chance per 10 HPS of damage taken that the mutant will explode.
So if this mutant took 20 HPS of damage the referee could check to see if the mutant explosively decompresses (2 in 1000 chance).
Exploding while pressurized will inflict 7 to 84 (7d12) hit points of damage to the mutant.
Bystanders are unaffected by explosive decompression of the mutation.
If the mutant chooses she can also explode right out of her armour inflicting 3 to 18 (3d6) hit points of damage to herself in the process.

== 38) Radiating Eyes 

// insert table 936

This mutant can launch a beam of radiation from her eyes.
The beam is about 30 cm wide and is two dimensional.
It appears to onlookers that the mutant has flashed yellow lazers at her targets.
The radiation beam and the mutant herself will register when detecting radiation.
The beam is composed of killing radiation with an intensity of 2-12 (2d6) plus one intensity per experience level.
The attack can be made every second unit of combat.
If the target's save is successful she will only take half damage from the attack.
Full damage is 1d4 per intensity of radiation.
For more information about saving throws and radiation poisoning see http://expgame.com/?page_id=275[Chapter 16: Special Rolls].

== 39) Regeneration 

// insert table 937

Every cell in this mutant's body is capable of recreating its nearest neighbour, and can do so with tremendous speed.
The mutation cannot regenerate lost limbs, but it can quickly repair the damage inflicted by wounds.

The mutant's body is constantly healing itself.
As long as she is not comatose (her hit point total is greater than 0) she will heal 1 hit point a unit for every 5 points of adjusted CON+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++This means that a 4th level mutant with a 16 +++<b>+++CON +++</b>+++would heal 4 HPS every unit.
The healing is complete and accurate.
There is no scarring, and the mutant is as good as new when she is returned to HPS Maximum.
This form of background regeneration does not work if the persona has less than 0 HPS+++<b>+++, +++</b>+++at this point she is dying like any other persona.

Massive reconstructive regeneration can be carried out automatically by the body, or whenever the mutant wishes.
Massive reconstruction involves the re-routing of blood, the slapping together of flesh, and the manipulation of other systems.
When this is done the mutant can instantly heal two HPS per point of adjusted CON+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++This can be carried out once a day per 7 points of adjusted CON+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++The body will instinctively carry out massive reconstruction if the mutant's HPS total drops below zero.
A 4th level mutant with a 10 CON could massively reconstruct 28 HPS worth of damage no more than twice a day.
If massive reconstructions is not sufficient to get the mutant up to a positive HPS total she will die like any other mutant.
See http://expgame.com/?page_id=267[Chapter 13: Health].

Regeneration will reject any foreign tissue attachments, grafts, or cybernetic connections vigorously.
The mutation is extremely self protective and will only accept its own reconstructions of its own tissues.

== 40) Rubbery+++<b>++++++</b>+++Skin 

// insert table 938

The mutant's skin is replaced by rubber.
This fabulous slippery skin comes in an assortment of wild and wonderful colours.
These colours, or even meticulous patterns can-be chosen by the player, or rolled randomly be the referee.
Rubbery skin can even be elaborately painted without any harm coming to the mutant.
The mutant is also immune to infections, parasites, skin conditions, or common colds.
The mutant need not wear any protective clothing in all but the harshest meteorological conditions.
Rubber dissolving aerosols will inflict 3 to 30 HPS of damage to this mutant.

== 41) Rust 

// insert table 939

Any metal touched by the mutant will instantly rust away.
This means any metal like substance touched by any part of the mutant will be spontaneously oxidized.
The mutant oxidizes the metal via an electromagnetic imbalance that is essential for maintaining her existence.

The body requires the change in electron status of the of metals in order to maintain equilibrium.
Each time the mutant touches something half her body wate in metal will oxidize into dust.
Not all metals are effected equally by the mutant, and the damaging effect can vary drastically.
Many artifacts are combinations of alloys, of metals and plastics, or wholly ceramic.
The sphincter dice described in http://expgame.com/?page_id=275[Chapter 16: Special]http://expgame.com/?page_id=275[Rolls] will be used to determine the metal content of such items.
The bottom line is that the mutant is unable to use anything mechanical.

In combat the rust mutation can be quite complicated.
Swords used against the mutant will only hit once before they are destroyed.
Bullets will disintegrate on impact, but they will still inflict their damage.
Robots will take 10 to 100 (10d10) hit points of damage, plus two rolls on the malfunction.
If a robot demolition table is being used simply move the bot down two levels on the demolition table.
The mutant need only touch the robot to inflict this damage, and she will receive a +500 bonus on her attack roll.
Regardless of the wate of the robot, it will take only the damage indicated.
Robots are composed of many materials, and the rust mutation will severely damage them, not completely disintegrate them.

== 42) Self Destruction 

// insert table 940

Within the cells of this mutant's body is a biochemical byproduct of cellular respiration that is quite explosive.
If the neural signals coming from the mutant's stress center become too great there is a 1 in 1000 chance of the mutant self destructing in glorious technicolor.
The explosion is a dangerous one, inflicting a d10 in damage per experience level of the mutant.
The more experience the more of the chemical that has been deposited.
If by some means this biochemical byproduct is removed from the mutant's cells it will begin to deposit again, reaching explosive levels within hours.

Situations where a self destruction check is warranted are going into battle, losing a fellow expedition member, ending a ursidae frenzy, losing a game of checkers, or  if the player throws something at the referee.
A roll of 042 on kilodice will indicate self destruction.
This mutation may be kept secret from the player.
However this would not be nice.
This mutation is a defect and does not count as a startup mutation.
The player should get another roll on the Physical Mutations Table.
This mutant will keep setting off explosives detectors.

== 43) Shape Change 

// insert table 941

The mutant can completely rearrange the shape of her body.
She can change the pigmentation of her skin, and alter its texture to match anything that she has seen.
She can alter her internal structure to mimic the shape of any shape that she desires.
Ultimately the mutant can imitate the external structure of anything that she has seen.
The mutant's thinkspace is not strong enough to shape change into an imagined object, it must be something that she had visualized.
The mutant could shape change into anything, a large box, another persona, a robot, or an alien.

The mutant will not be able to recreate any of the special attacks that creature had, nor will she be able to record information like the previous machine could, nor will she be able to carry out any of the class skills that the persona had.
The mutant can alter her wate by more than 50% less, or 50% greater.
If the mimicked creature is much larger than the mutant she may turn herself into a scale replica of it.

The transformation takes 6 to 60 (6d10) units and is messy and noisy.
Bones have to be broken, major organs soften and are temporarily pushed out of the body, bodily fluids are released and then recovered, etc.
During this state the mutant is helpless, and any damage taken will be tripled.
The shape change being made cannot be adjusted while the transformation is taking place.

There is a 3% chance that the mutant will get stuck at the transformation phase, and lay unconscious for 0 to 5 (d6-1) days.
During this period she will slowly return to her normal shape.
The shape change will last for 1 minute (30 units) per point of adjusted CON.
At the end of this time the mutant will spontaneously shape change back into her normal form.

== 44) Size Manipulation 

// insert table 942

The mutant can cause the molecules of her body to fall in on each other just enough to decrease her size proportionally.
She can also cause them to expand slightly and therefore increase her size in a proportional fashion.
The changes are both immediate and complete.
The mutant's equipment is unaffected by the change, and this can result in oversized clothing, or tearing ones clothes asunder.

Making oneself smaller involves decreasing the space between every molecule in her body.
The result is proportional decrease is size that can make her up to 75% smaller.
There is no change in the mutant's body wate.
The decrease in size does not make her weaker, but it does make her a little bit more dense and harder to hit.
There is a bonus of +75 on her armour rating when the persona is shorter.

The mutant can increase her size by up to 50% when she slightly increases the space between her molecules.
There is no change on any of her attributes, a slight change in her density, but she can make herself considerably taller.
The mutant will receive a bonus of plus whatever percent she increased her size by onto her damage adjustment.
Note that her physical strength has not increased, but her leverage has.

== 45)  Skin Structure Change 

// insert table 943

This skin of this mutant has been radically altered to some genomic anomaly.
The majority of the skin structure changes are defensive in nature.
They all function as normal skin except for their described appearance, and change in base armour rating.
Refer to Table 59.17: Skin Structure Change to determine how the mutant's skin is different.
None of the skin alterations affect the mutant's CHA.
The altered skin structure is the mutant's natural skin.
When not wearing armour a mutant's armour rating is normally 500.
The Skin Structure Change table lists the changes to the mutant's AR.
This value is added to the mutant's AR regardless of how she is armoured.
If the mutant can wear armour with this mutation then her AR will be adjusted by the value.
Thus an unarmoured mutant with thatched skin would have an AR of 590, and any armour she were wearing would have a bonus  of +90.
Note that wearing armour may be an insulting idea to a mutant with naturally armoured skin.

// insert table 944

== 46) Smoke Screen 

// insert table 945

This mutant's back can heat up, ignite secretions located on her skin.
The combusting material will generate thick vision obscuring smoke.
The mutant can instantly heat up her back to generate the thick smoke.
The cloud does not inhibit one's ability to breath, but it is completely disorienting and cannot be seen through.
There is a chance that when the mutant is stressed she will instinctively release the cloud, say while talking to a banker, getting a speeding ticket, or in an argument with another persona.

If the mutant stands still the smoke will create a cloud 2 hexes high with a 5 hex radius.
If the mutant is moving she will create a wall of smoke 2 hexes high and 1 hex wide.
The wall of smoke will follow as she moves for 2 units.
The cloud will last for 1 to 12 minutes before settling or being dissipated.

There is also a 15% chance that the mutant will have an explosive smoke screen This smoke screen ignite violently when provoked by an open flame (match, gunfire, energy weapons).
Anything within the smoke screen at that moment will take 1d10 in damage per experience level of the mutant.

== 47)  Sonic Attack 

// insert table 946

There is a billows in this mutant's neck which allows her blast air through her specialized vocal cords.
The scream created is composed of high and low frequency wavelengths of damaging sound.
Immediately before the mutant attacks her neck billows out to beyond her nose.

The amount of damage inflicted is determined on Table 59.18: Sonic Damage Range.
The mutant is unaffected by her own sonic attack, unless it is somehow reflected back to her.
The sonic attack has a radius (in hexes) equal to the mutant's adjusted PSTR.
A 2nd level mutant with a 10 PSTR have a radius of effect of 12 hexes.
Organic and inorganic audio systems can be rendered inoperative if they take more than 15 hit points of damage.
If 15 (or more) hit points of damage is delivered a recovery roll must be made, or &8220;deafness&8221;
will result.
Organic systems will remain deaffor 1-8 hours, but inorganic audio systems must await repair.
Sonic attacks can be launched once a day for every two points of adjusted PSTR.

// insert table 947

== 48) Spit Poison 

// insert table 948

The mutant has poison producing glands that can eject a spittle of poison tremendous distances.
The gland requires a 3 unit wait period while it recharges itself.
Thus the mutant can spit poison every 4 units.
The type of poison generated by the mutant is determined on Table 59.19: Poison Generation.
The effects of each poison are discussed in the following paragraphs.

// insert table 949

Death::
A highly toxic spittle of death is released by this mutant.
Any organic personas hit by this attack must save versus a poison.
Those who do not save will take damage from the attack.
This poison inflicts a 1d4 hit points in damage per point of poison intensity.
Those targets which do save will only take half damage.
The poison intensity is 1 to 8 plus experience level

Nausea::
Those that fail their saving throw will be incapacitated with nausea.
They will be unable to act for 1 to 8 minutes (30 units).
Those that make their saving throw will be unaffected by the poison.
The poison intensity is 1 to 8 plus experience level.

Paralysis::
The paralysis poison leaves its affected targets unable to move any of their voluntary muscles for 3 to 30 (3d10) units.
The save must be made by anyone that is hit by the spittle.
Those that make their saving throw will be unaffected by the poison.
The poison intensity is 1 to 8 plus experience level.

Unconsciousness::
This nasty spittle causes instantaneous unconsciousness for those organic creatures that do not save vs poison.
Targets will remain unconscious until awakened.
In a normal combat setting this would be 0 to 3 units.
Otherwise they will lay dormant for days.
Those that make their saving throw will be unaffected by the poison.
The poison intensity is 1 to 8 plus experience level.

== 49) Static Quills 

// insert table 950

This mutant's body is completely covered with quills, spines, thorns and other nasty pointy things.
The layer of quills is thick and offers an armour rating bonus of +101, but the mutant is unable to wear armour of any sort.
She even has a slight chance of puncturing a vac suit.
Any type A attack that involves a creature's punch, bite, or claw will inflict a 1d6 plus 1 hit point per level of damage to the attacker.
Thus a 5th level mutant with static quills would have an armoured armour rating of 601, and would inflict 6 to 11 HPS of damage to any creature that attempts (makes a attack roll) against her.

//+++<figure id="attachment_5364" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5364" style="width: 218px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i2.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tentaclesmutation.688-218x300.png?resize=218%2C300[Strange new body parts.,218]](https://i1.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tentaclesmutation.688.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5364" class="wp-caption-text">+++Strange new body parts.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== 50) Strange New Body Parts 

// insert table 951

Just like the title of the mutation states the mutant has some strange new body part that is uncommon to her species.
If the body part rolled on Table 59.20: Strange New Body Parts is not unique to her persona's species, then the player can roll again.
The strange new body parts are discussed in the following paragraphs.

// insert table 952

Antennae::
The mutant has a pair of insectoid like antennae sticking out of the top of her head.
There is a 90% chance that the antennae will give the mutant a sensor skill similar in effect to Sonar (Mental Mutation ).

Ears::
The mutant has a pair of unique ears, large elephant ears, or floppy rabbit ears.
The ears are purely decorative, and this mutation does not count as a startup mutation.
The player can roll again on the Physical Mutation Table.

Eyes::
 Giant bug out oversized reflective eyes give this mutant a wide angle view of life.
Improving the chance to notice ambush by doubling her AWE during ambush.

Eyestalks::
 The mutant's eyes are now located atop retractable and articulated eyestalks.
The mutant can extend her eyes from her head by about 30 cm.
She could use these to increase her cover when firing around a corner.

Fins::
 The mutant will have a dorsal stabilizing fin, and webbed hands and feet.
This mutation will allow any persona to swim in water at a speed equal to her movement rate on land.

Gills::
These gills are located on the side of the mutant's neck, and offer her an additional breathing apparatus.
The gills function both in and out of water, and allow her to breath in liquid.

Horns::
The mutant has a set of horns sticking out of the sides of her head.
There will be 1 to 4 pairs of horns located on her head.
The horns are purely decorative, and do not count as a start up mutation.
The player can roll again on the Physical Mutation Table.

Mouth::
The mutant's mouth is replaced with some other sort of obscure oral access device.
Like a beak, trunk, proboscis, or an osmotic absorptive sheet.
The strange new mouth is purely decorative, and does not count as a start up mutation.
The player can roll again on the Physical Mutation Table.

Nose::
This mutant has a strange new nose.
It can be missing, inverted, elephant like, clown like, merely a hole, or some other peculiar variation.
The strange new nose is purely decorative, and does not count as a start up mutation.
The player can roll again on the Physical Mutation Table.

Oral Grapple::
This is a metal covered bone shaped like a grappling hook.
The mutant can shoot the oral grapple from her mouth.
It has a range of 2 hexes and attacks as a type B weapon.
Anything that the grapple hits will take 1d8 in damage, and have grapple firmly lodged into it.
The mutant can retract, and release the grapple at will.
The mutant can reel the oral grapple in using her PSTR.
The oral grapple will be severed if it takes more than 15% of the mutant's hit point maximum in one attack.
A severed grapple will grow back in 1 to 6 months.

Pincers::
Protruding from the mutant's mouth are a pair of large serrated pincers.
The mutant can dexterously manipulate her food with these pincers, or she can use them to violently attack as a type A weapon.
If a hit is scored they will inflict 1 to 8 (1d8) hit points in damage.

Spike::
The spike resembles a unicorn's spike sticking from the persona's forehead, and it can be used in the same fashion.
The spike can be used as a type A weapon that inflicts 1 to 12 (1d12) HPS in damage.

Tail::
 The mutant has a nice long articulated tail protruding from her hindquarters.
This tail can be used to manipulate objects, or to lift the mutant from the ground.
The tail is fully functional and acts as an extra articulation.

Tentacles::
The mutant will have 1 to 6 tentacles replacing 1 to 4 limbs.
Each tentacle rolled will replace one limb.
If there are 5 or 6 tentacles replacing 4 limbs then the mutant will have 1 or 2 extra limbs.
She will be able to use the extra limbs as arms or legs depending on what is needed at the time.
For example, she could have extra attacks, or increase her movement by 10% per extra limb.

Turtle Shell::
This mutant has a fully functional turtle shell into which she can retract her arms, legs, head and what ever other appendages she has.
The shell is very strong, and when completely retracted into it the mutant's AR is 777, and she is immune to poisons, gases, and has a doubled CON versus radiation.
The shell can withstand twice the mutant's HPS Maximum before it will break.
The turtle shell will heal one quarter the normal healing rate.
This mutation increases the mutant's CR by 3.


== 51) Symbiotic Attachment 

// insert table 953

Externally this mutation appears as a long umbilical cord with a gnarly suction cup attached to the end.
The cord is an extension of the mutant's nervous system, and the cup at the end has all the agents, enzymes and neurotransmitters necessary to take over another creatures nervous system.
There is a 17% chance that the mutant will have a symbiotic attachment that can interface with inorganic machines.

The mutant must first score a attack roll near the mutant's central nervous system.
This attack roll must be successful even if the target wishes to be attached.
The next unit the target gets a saving throw versus poison (the attacker's neurotransmitters), and if she fails the mutant completely controls the target.
The intensity of the attack is equal to the mutant's adjusted CON.
The target must make a save, or be controlled, every unit that the symbiotic attachment is connected to her.
Each unit that the target is struggling she will take 1 to 3 hit points in daniage.
An unconscious target can be automatically controlled without the benefit of a saving throw.

During the struggle the target can pull the attachment from her body if she successfully makes a PSTR attribute roll.
This will inflict 2d4 HPS of damage to herself, but it will remove the attachment.
The umbilical cord can be severed if it takes more than 20% of the mutant's HPS Max in one attack.
A severed symbiotic attachment will be treated as any other severed limb.
Any damage done to the cord will be delivered to the mutant also.

If control is successful the mutant completely controls the body that she has attached to, and has access to all memories skills and abilities that the target has.
The player has essentially extended her mutant to two personas.
10% of any damage taken by the attached creature will be delivered to the controlling mutant.
The attached creature will be freed if the mutant allows her to go, or if the controlling mutant is knocked unconscious.
If the mutant is knocked unconscious by something that doesn't affect her target the target is free.+++<figure id="attachment_5365" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5365" style="width: 249px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i1.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/detachablehands.690.png?resize=249%2C181[Seeing is in the hands of the beholder.,249]](https://i1.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/detachablehands.690.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5365" class="wp-caption-text">+++Seeing is in the hands of the beholder.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== 52) Tearaway Body Parts 

// insert table 954

Under the correct circumstances the mutant can remove parts of her body while keeping them under her mental control.
The mutation is as disgusting as imaginable.
The mutant could tear off an arm and have it to open a door while she stands far away from the area.
She could remove an eye and leave it in a room to carry out some spying, or tack an ear to the wall to listen in on a conversation.
If the mutant were to leave an eye and an arm somewhere she would be able to attack from far away.
When the job was done she could get the arm to gather the eye and crawl back to the mutant.

The mutant can keep track of 1 loose body part per two levels of experience.
The mutant must be within 1 hex per adjusted MSTR of her body part.
If she leaves the range of effect the body part will immediately begin to decompose.
As it is the mutant can only leave a part detached from her body for up to 1 hour per point of adjusted CON, without it beginning to decompose.

Body parts have a HPS total equal to 10% of the mutant's HPs maximum.
This amount of hit points is set regardless of the size or importance of the detached body part.
If the body part should start to decompose it will take a 1d8 in hit points each hour it is left unattended.
If the body part is reduced to zero hit points for any reason it is dead, and the mutant cannot reattach it.
The mutant does not have any ability whatsoever to regenerate her dead body parts.

== 53) Undersized Body Parts 

// insert table 955

This mutation is a defect that should be obvious to all concerned personas.
The mutant has some body part that is obviously undersized, altering the persona's attributes, and shape.
This mutation is a defect and does not count as a start up mutation.
The player should roll again on the Physical Mutation Table.

// insert table 957

== 54) Vibrations 

// insert table 956

The neurons in this mutant's body can set up harmonic patterns which cause her hand to vibrate at predetermined frequencies.
This mutant can call on her hands to produce a relaxing comforting pulse at any time.
This skill can be used to soothe other personas with an incredible massage.

During combat or other periods of stress the mutant can vibrate her hands at super high frequencies which will allow her to damage anything that she touches.
When attacking with type A punching attacks she will inflict an extra 3d4 hit points of damage if she hits, and she will receive a bonus +97 to hit with punching attacks.
Combat vibrations can be employed for 1 unit per point of adjusted PSTR.
Damaging vibrations can only be initiated once a day per 3 points of adjusted DEX*.*

If she punches or holds something specifically intending to break it the mutant can quadruple her PSTR when making such an attribute roll.
This can only be done on stationary inorganic objects and cannot be achieved during combat.
A successful PSTR attribute roll will shatter what ever she is concentrating on.
This would count as one of the daily uses of the mutation.

== 55) Vision Defect 

// insert table 959

The optical sensors of this mutant are somehow defective in a peculiar sort of way.
The mutation is challenging to run for the referee since these eye defects will only come into effect every once in a while.
The player makes one roll on Table 59.22: Vision Defect, and the table describes what effect the defect has on the mutant.
This mutation is a defect and does not count as a startup mutation.
The player should roll again on the Physical Mutation Table.

_// insert table 958_

== 56) Wate Manipulation 

// insert table 961

This mutant can adjust her body wate at will.
She can instantly increase her wate by absorbing water and airborne particles and plumping herself up.
The mutant will not appreciably increase in size, but she will appear to bloat.
When manipulating her wate upwards she is capable of tripling her body wate.
Conversely the mutant can spew out frothy jets of unnecessary bodily fluids and jellies to decrease her body wate to a third what it regularly is.
There is no noticeable decrease in the mutant's size, but she will appear much thinner.

The benefits of altering ones wate are the obvious ones.
The mutant becomes easier to carry, or harder to move.
The mutant can fall with more force, or they can climb more easily.
In movement the mutant will move 50% slower when heavier, and 25% faster when lighter.
There is also a +25% bonus on non-powered weapons damage adjustments when attacking in the wate increased form.
The mutant will return to her normal wate if she is knocked unconscious.

== 57) Wings 

// insert table 962

Regardless of this mutant's race she will have a lovely set of wings which arise from her back.
These wings allow the mutant to fly through the air with the greatest of ease.
All encumbrance effects as described in http://expgame.com/?page_id=279[Chapter 18: Encumbrance], apply to the flying mutant.
The mutant will be able to fly at a base rate that js twice her land movement rate.
If the mutant's speed is particularly fast she may be required to make driving maneuver rolls for certain actions.
Maneuver rolls are discussed in http://expgame.com/?page_id=277[Chapter ]http://expgame.com/?page_id=277[17: Driving].
The mutant would have to be flying faster than 18 h/u to before being required to make driving PT rolls.
The wingspan of the mutant is such that she is unable to fly indoors, requiring at least a 2 hex wide corridor for maneuvering, and at least a 3 hex ceiling.
