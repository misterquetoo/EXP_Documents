Rodentia are fur covered humanoids with paws, rodent heads and tails (whenever applicable).
Rodentia can also be referred to as rodents or Homo Rodens.
Some rodent types that a player can choose from are listed here: beaver (Canadian eh!), kangaroo, rat, mouse, mole, vole, porcupine, hedgehog, gopher, platypus, hamster, gerbil, squirrel, etc.
No matter which rodent type is chosen, the persona remains a bipedal humanoid who possesses no natural abilities other than those detailed here.
For example, a beaver can chew down timber and construct dams better than a civil engineer can chew down trees and construct dams.
The only dam building experience a beaver persona could have would be through civil engineering (the mechanic class).

== Movement Bonus

Rodentia earn a 20% bonus on their movement rate.
So a rodent that moves 5 h/u as determined on the Movement Table would actually move at 6 h/u.
Rodents are unaffected when scuttling through the underbrush or similar floral terrain coverings.

== Night Vision
Rodentia also enjoy 12 hex night/day vision which is disrupted by alternative light sources such as torches and searchlights.
Thus the night/day vision can only operate in the absence of significant light.
