= Chapter 55: Support Equipment


Support equipment's title is self explanatory.
The list of support equipment consists of devices, or materials, designated for use in other artifacts.
Types of support equipment are: batteries, ammunition, fuel, manuals, and spare parts--not brassieres, or jockstraps.
Support equipment is generally useless on its own.
It has no greater purpose than to be employed as a disposable counterpart to more useful equipment.
Many toys require support equipment: guns need ammo;
detectors need batteries;
vehicles need fuel;
medical equipment needs instructions;
etc.;
etc.#+++<figure id="attachment_10207" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10207" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i2.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/naudosauce_2-300x246.jpg?resize=300%2C246[Naudsonce by H.

Many players respond to the idea of support equipment with a resounding gag.
The idea conjures up more stuff cluttering the already chaotic TOY system.
What these people must realize is that, regardless of their level of involvement in the technologies, they already have some idea of support equipment.
Weapons will have battery limits.
Vehicles will have maximum ranges.
Such limits automatically indicate the need for support equipment.
When a lazer rifle's charge is depleted;
it #needs new batteries.
How many batteries does the weapon require?
What type of batteries?
Support equipment has the answer to such pragmatic and probing questions.
Regardless, never let record keeping or dice rolling get in the way of the story.#

== Generating# 

To determine what kind of support equipment is being generated refer to Table 55.1: Support Equipment.
Before randomly generating support equipment the referee should consider having the support equipment support one of the expedition's existing TOYs.
EXP is the game of technological chaos, but sometimes randomness should fall in favour of persona's equipment working.
These tables are organized to support support equipment being #determined randomly (the lairs of mechanics are a good source of such useless items).#

// insert table 736

== Amount of Support Equipment

The amount of support equipment can always be adjusted by the referee to best accommodate the nature of the campaign.
For a pure support equipment die roll use the following table to determine amount of equipment.
Keep in mind that a 5 year supply of space vehicle fuel may represent infrastructure that an entire campaign could be built upon.

// insert table  1062

== 1) Ammunition# 

Ammunition is so important to most weapons that it can hardly be considered support equipment.
Most guns are useless, unless being used as a club, without ammo.
Ammunition specifications must be determined for a weapon which has already been generated, or for random stashes of ammunition.#

=== Ammunition For An Initial Weapon 

Ammunition being generated for an existing weapon is a special case were the referee may need to modify the amounts to keep the campaign in balance.
Each set of ammunition will indicated what is needed for a complete magazine for the weapon.
If the weapon requires ammunition and batteries both will be supplied.
If the weapon just has ammunition (like a bolt action rifle) there will either be a number of bullets representing that number of sets, or they could be pre-loaded into magazines.
It is considered good referee etiquette to match a found stash of ammunition to one of the player's existing weapons.
If this were to create an imbalance in game play then the referee must make the appropriate changes.
#

=== Ammunition Found Independent of An Initial TOY 

This section represents an ammo cache that is independent of the existing persona's weapons.
An ammo cache can arise from an independent TOY roll by a persona or a referee.
When determining a random ammunition cache the referee must generate all aspects of the ammunition including: weapon type, weapon power level (caliber), and weapon tech level.
To determine these properties of random ammo follow #the four steps listed below.#

// insert table 737

// insert table 1063

// insert table 738 /] + [table id=642

== 2) Batteries 

Most toys require an energy source.
Portable equipment have limited energy sources in the form of batteries.
Before any artifact that requires batteries can function, the device must have a full set of batteries that are of the correct type, and of the correct tech level.
Every new toy that uses #batteries must roll the number of cells, and the battery type required for operation.
The battery requirements of the toy can be determined on Table 55.3: Cells Required+++<i>+++, +++</i>+++and Table 55.4: Battery Type__.__#

The number of batteries that accompany an artifact is entirely up to the referee.
If the TOY is a weapon that will be decided by the number of magazines rolled at start up.
If the device is not a gun then there will be 0-5 extra battery sets at start up.
Found and start up batteries are determined exactly the same by roll how many battery sets, how many batteries per set and the type of battery.

There is a 10% chance that the batteries will come in the form of a single multicell.
If the batteries are a multicell then there is a 10% chance that the multicell will be a powerpack.

The game should not be about batteries unless that is fun for the play group.
Batteries should only be employed intensely if they are contributing to the milieu or the story of the campaign.

=== Batteries per Set 

Table 55.3: Cells Required determines how many batteries an artifact needs to operate.
This can be a boon or a bust.
If a device needs 8 batteries to operate lasts a year on a battery set and then the persona gets 5 extra battery sets that can be a lot of extra power.
If the persona has a weapon that uses 6 batteries per magazine that will burn through a lot of batteries.

If the modified roll on Table 55.3: Cells Required is reduced to zero the device has no appreciable power source but works fine.
This is excellent but there will be no extra batteries in surplus.

// insert table 739

=== Battery Type 

Table 55.4: Battery Type determines the kind of battery cell that the device runs on.
Most are simple cells that use chemistry and science fantasy to generate power for the device.
Others require some thought on the part of the referee.
#

// insert table 740

*1) Gas*:This cell contains chemicals reacting in a gaseous state.
This cell is rechargeable.
This cell will cease to function if it is exposed to a extreme cold (cryo attacks).#

*2) Liquid*:Chemicals in the liquid state are used to produce energy in this cell.
A liquid cell will be destroyed if it is exposed to a vacuum.
The liquid cell is rechargeable.#

*3) Solid*:A solid cell produces the reaction of crystals to produce energy.
Solid cells are rechargeable.
They are destroyed when exposed to temperatures over 500Â°C (fusion attacks, napalm blasts, or spaceship drives).#

*4) Plasmoid*:Unreleasable superheated gases are used to produce energy for the cell.
Plasmoid cells are rechargeable.
A plasmoid cell will not function if it is in less than 1/2 gravity.#

*5) Dynamo*:Internal dynamos manufacture the useable energies of this cell.
The dynamo can be reactivated if is properly respun.
The dynamo will be destroyed if exposed to extreme gravity.#

*6) Solar*:A solar cell is self rechargeable.
#When drained of energy a solar cell will recharge itself with hour's exposure to light.
The cells must be removed from the artifact to recharge.
Extreme brightness, flash attacks, nuclear flares, will destroy the cell if it is recharging.#

*7) Magnetic*:Magnetic cells are self rechargeable.
If there is 1000 tonnes of solid matter present magnetic cells will recharge themselves in one hour.
The #cell must be removed from the toy to recharge, and remain laying on the ground for the entire hour.
These cells are destroyed if exposed to magnetic disruptions while recharging (magnetic grenades, fusion attack, black holes).#

**8) Broadcas**t: Broadcast cells are actually power receivers that convert transmissions from a power source into energy.
The receivers cease to function if they are electronically jammed, or are taken out of the broadcast range.
If the broadcast source is destroyed, the cells will cease to function.
The range of broadcast power is up the referee.
Essentially unlimited battery power.

*9) Psionic*: Psionic cells are continuously self recharging.
Whenever a psionic cell is depleted it will consume 1 point of MSTR from the nearest thinkspace.
This will usually be the persona using the artifact.
By draining that 1 point of MSTR the batteries will all be recharged to full.
The persona being drained must win a save versus mental attack to avoid losing the MSTR.
The intensity of the attack 3d6.
If the nearest persona saves the batteries will move onto the next nearest persona.
If every persona saves within a 25 hex radius the batteries must wait until a new MSTR comes into range.
A psionic multicell is no more dangerous than a regular battery, but a psionic powerpack can be deadly.

=== Batteries as Multicells 

Multi-cells are single batteries that have the power output of several batteries.
A four power multi-cell could charge an artifact which requires four normal cells.
A multi-cell is not a power pack, and cannot yield four sets of charges to an artifact that only requires 1 cell.
Multi-cells have the same wate as a regular battery (100 gm), see battery wate for more information.
Multicells cost much more (see battery cost).
A multi-cell will act as d8 batteries of equivalent power.
Remember that multi-cells will only operate on toys of the same battery type.
To determine a multi-cell's battery type roll on Table 55.4: Battery Type#

=== Batteries in Powerpacks# 

Power packs are designed to plug into artifacts, and offer a continuous source of power in excess of one charge.
To determine the amount of energy in a power pack, a roll is made on Table 55.5: Powerpack Capacity+++<i>+++.
+++</i>+++As a matter of politeness, power packs are delivered to personas fully charged.
Remember that power packs will only work on artifacts of the same cell type.
To determine a power pack's battery type roll on Table 55.4: Battery Type#.#

The power pack's capacity indicates the number of cells that the power pack is equal to.
The device can operate under various power drains, but it runs out faster the greater the artifact's power requirements.
E.g., an artifact requiring 5 batteries per charge, is connected to a power pack with a capacity of 15 batteries.
The artifact can be run continually for 3 full charges.
Power packs have a wate of 1 kg plus .050 kg per battery equivalent.#

// insert table 741

=== Battery Wate# 

All batteries, including multi-#cells, have a wate of 0.1 kg (100 gm).
Power packs have a total wate of 1 kg plus .050 kg per battery charge.
Thus a self recharging 20 battery solar #power pack would have a wate of 11.0 kg (1 kg + 20 x 0.50).

=== Battery EXPS 

The experience point award earned for #correctly identifying batteries is 1 EXPS per eps of value.
This experience point award cannot exceed #500 EXPS.

=== Battery Value 

The value of a battery depends on its cell power (see multicell), and the battery type.
The cell power indicates  the number of batteries the cell is equivalent to (multi-cell).
A base normal battery has a value of 100 eps.
A 5 cell multicell is worth 5 times as much at 500 eps.
#

Self recharging batteries like  solar and magnetic battery are worth 10 times the listed cell value.
Continuously charged batteries like psionic, and broadcast #batteries are 100 times more costly than the listed value.
Powerpacks are worth 200 eps per cell charge stored, and are also modified by the battery type they supply. So a solar battery power pack that holds 20 batteries would have a value  0f 40 000 (20 x 200 x 10).#

== 3) Fuel 

Fuel is designated for the engines of vehicles and spaceships.
An engine's fuel type is determined when the vehicle or spacecraft is generated.
If a vehicle or space vehicle is generated on the TOY system it will have 0 to 3 (1d4-1) refills available to it from the start.
How the fuel is stored is up to the referee.
A hundred tonnes of space vehicle fuel could require an entire facility to look after it.
Whereas a 1o0 kg of vehicle fuel  could be stored in drums.
How this is done is entirely up to the referee.
If your campaign is about fuel scarcity you can ignore this part of support equipment.
The story leads the rules, not vice versa#

=== Fuel Type 

While the fuel type is easily decided on Table 55.5: Fuel Type.
#All the fuel types function in the same fashion.
A kg of solid fuel is the same as a kilogram of liquid fuel.
It is up to the referee to decide if solar or magnetic fuel systems need to be recharged.
For example the vehicle may need to bask in the sun for a while to recharge.
Broadcast fuel indicates continuous function within a certain range of the broadcast tower.
How would this work for space vehicles?
I would not want to stand next to a power broadcast antennae for a space vehicle.

// insert table 742

=== Fuel Amount 

However the amount of fuel found is more difficult to determine.
None of the vehicles in EXP are given a fuel capacity in either liters, kilograms, or solar cells.
This makes refueling them with a found depot a bit tricky.
There is 1 in 10 chance that a fuel depot will refuel spaceships.
This will indicate way more fuel than a regular vehicle depot.##

==== Fuel for Vehicle 

For a random vehicle fuel depot there will be 10 to 1000 kg (10d100) of fuel available.
The amount and type of fuel will decide how the depot is stored.
This may create some significant work for the referee.
Several hundred kgs of  liquid fuel could be stored in cans, in an underground tank.
While solid fuel could just be a pile on the ground.
The tank will hold 3% of the vehicle wate in fuel to determine a full tank.
So a Car that has a wate of 3000 kg would have a 100 kg full fuel tank and 300 kg of fuel would be give it 3 full ranges.
There will never be a enough fuel in a vehicle fuel depot to fuel a space vehicle in any way.

*Full range or Full tank = 3% of vehicle wate*

==== Fuel for Space Vehicle 

For a random space vehicle fueling depot there will be 20 to 200 tonnes (1d10 times 20) of fuel.
#Deciding a depot's fuel capacity in this manner will also indicate how compatible a vehicle is to the facilities.
Usually a space vehicle fueling depot will indicate a complete scenario, or site location, that the referee must prepare.
If a vehicle matches the fuel type of a space vehicle there is access to basically limitless fuel.
But how do you fill up a moped at a spaceship refuelling station?
Carefully.

== 4) Manuals# 

The discovery of manuals for toys can completely shift the course of an evening of gaming, and possibly the course of an entire campaign.
Manuals have two basic formats: #instructional, and repair.
The benefits of trying to identify an artifact in collaboration with its manual should be obvious.
Mechanics get their greatest bonuses when repairing devices with the aid of a repair manual.
The chance of a manual occurring with a toy depends mostly on the scenario in which the artifact #was found.
Toys discovered in the rubble of some mutant's lair are not likely to be accompanied by repair manuals.
However, the unopened crate stolen from the cargo hold of an air car is likely to have a detailed instruction manual.
#

If a player has rolled a manual as support equipment then the manual will most likely be connected to one of her TOYs created in the same session.
This is called being nice.
There is a 1 in 4 chance that the manual will be a repair manual and not an instruction manual.
In EXP the two shall never appear at the same time.

Some brief instructions about manuals:#
 They are valuable, and may be worth as much as the artifact itself.
 they can be massive, reaching several volumes in length.#
 they can be small, built into the artifact itself.#
 they can be incorrect.
 they will usually be a hardcopy or a fancy reader
 they can have a format.
See Table 55.6: Software Format

=== Instruction Manual 

The vast majority of manuals will be instruction manuals.
It may be as simple as a pamphlet (timepiece) or as gargantuan as a computer system (space vehicle).
Instruction manuals offer an http://expgame.com/?page_id=284[AID bonus] of +10 and assist the persona in learning and making the artifact work.
Some petulant referees may decrease the EXPS value of artifacts identified using a manual.
A mechanic will gain a PT roll bonus of +10 when working on an artifact with an instruction manual.

=== Repair Manual 

Repair manuals are less common than instruction manuals.
They are essentially useless to anyone other than a mechanic.
Repair manuals only offer an http://expgame.com/?page_id=284[AID bonus] of +2 to assist the persona in learning and making the artifact work.
A bonus of +50 on the performance table roll is granted to a #mechanic when using a repair manual.#

==  5) Software 

Software is programming for computers, but without the computer.
Software can be as valuable as it can be useless.
If the persona has no artifact to install the software on it would be reasonable to allow the player and additional TOY roll.
If the persona has an artifact that can be programmed and the player has rolled software it would be best to have the software apply to that device.
This called being nice.
#

=== Software Format 

Usually the program will be delivered by downloading it from another system via modem, or something more exotic.
If the software must be delivered in some other #fashion refer to Table 55.6:  Software Format+++<i>+++.
+++</i>+++AI software will have a wate of 1 to 10 kg, and space vehicle software will have a wate equal to 1 to 10 kg per computer level.
The software formats should be equally effective, depending on the mood of the referee of course.
#The format of the software is largely phenotypic fun.
Software will always work in its designated type of computer.
Software in EXP will never have a manual.

*2) Class Computer*:This is software designated for use in class computers.
Class computers are dedicated to a certain persona class, and the software here will assist personas with technical maneuvers.
Software will adjust the DD of an appropriate maneuver downwards by 0-5 (d6-1) DDs.

*4) Robotic*: A robotic memory insert will  have software from either a class computer or an AI computer.
The software is prepared for insertion and integration into a robotic brain.
The software will give the robot the skill described by the program regardless of it's robotic type.
The robot #will be able to recall the data whenever she wishes, or use the skill as she wishes.
The software will either be inserted directly into a port on the robot or nailed in with a sledge hammer.
75% of the time  the roll will be made on Table 55.8: AI Computer Software the remainder of the time it will be on Table 55.9: Class Computer Software.##

*5) Biorganic*:A biorganic memory insert will have software from either a class computer or an AI computer.
The software is prepared for insertion and integration into an organic brain.
The software will give the user the skill described by the program regardless of the persona's class, anthro type, or mutations.
The persona #will be able to recall the data whenever she wishes, or use the skill as she wishes.
The software will either be inserted directly into the skull, programmed via the eyes and ears, or plugged into via a http://expgame.com/?page_id=343#47-mindlink[mindlink], or a http://expgame.com/?page_id=341#47-translinker[translinker].
25% of the time  the roll will be made on Table 55.8: AI Computer Software the remainder of the time it will be on Table 55.9: Class Computer Software.##

== 6) Spare Parts# 

This is more of a complementary section than anything else.
Rarely does a role-playing game get so involved in technology that it requires detailed rules about spare parts.
Spare parts usually enter into the game when some strategic piece of equipment (the one needed to save the universe) is in desperate need of repair.
Spare parts will always be related to some artifact existing in the expedition already.
Spare parts will appear as unidentifiable odds and sods that has a wate 25% of the artifact in question.
Spare parts will have no particular value.
A mechanic will gain +30 on PT repair maneuvers if spare parts are present.
