Bombs are a subsection of grenades.
Bombs are nothing more than great big grenades.
They have a greater area of effect, inflict more damage, and have longer durations than the grenades, or aerosols, that they are modelled after.
Many grenades, and aerosols, have special effects.
These effects are also increased when they are fashioned into bombs.
Clouds , fires, radioactivity, or ice fields will last 10 times longer.
The intensities of poisons are amplified by 10 as well.
The intensity of a bomb attack cannot exceed 25.

*Bombs are very deadly.*
Misuse of a fusion bomb would melt an entire expedition in a flash.
Even safe aerosols can become dangerous when amplified to the proportions of a bomb.
A foam bomb could entomb an entire unsuspecting expedition.

== Bomb Types

=== Grand Slam 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iii-hardware:CH45_Grenades.adoc#_big_bertha_grenade[Big Bertha]
Area of Effect:: 160h
Damage:: 120-1440 (12d12 x 10)
Wate:: 50kg 
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 50000

The Grand Slam is a concussion bomb.
Aside from doing massive damage it is designed to topple targets.

.*Big Bertha Effect*
* 160h range 12d12 damage
* 240h range stun
* 320h range topple

These effects are cumulative.
Stun is versus intensity 25.
Topple is versus intensity 25.

== Dissolver 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iii-hardware:CH45_Grenades.adoc#_corrosive_grenade[Corrosive Grenade]
Area of Effect:: 60h
Damage:: 50-400 (50d8)
Wate:: 25kg
EXPS:: 200
Value:: 15000

All targets in the area of effect take the initial damage of 50-400 on detonation.
Inorganic targets continue to take 20-200 (20d10) hit points per unit in the area of effect.
The dome of dissolving lasts 1-3 minutes. 
Designed for clearing out mobs of robotic targets.

=== Polarizer

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iii-hardware:CH45_Grenades.adoc#_cryoblast_grenade[Cryoblast Grenade]
Area of Effect:: 160h
Damage:: 30-300 (30d10)
Wate:: 25kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 25000

There is a 1% chance per hit point of damage inflicted of any target being trapped in ice.

=== Black Out Bomb 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iii-hardware:CH45_Grenades.adoc#_energy_drain_grenade[Energy Drain Grenade]
Area of Effect:: 60h, special
Damage:: Special
Wate:: 12kg
EXPS:: 275
Value:: 75000

The black out bomb will drain all batteries within 200 hexes.
The bomb uses the stolen energy for a killing attack with a 60 hex range.
The damage of the killing attack depends on the amount of energy around to drain.
If there is a power plant near by, the bomb will be ferocious.
If there are only batteries around the bomb will merely be lethal.

In a civic area this bomb would deliver 5-200 (50d4) hits points of damage.
Within 200h of a power plant detonation would do 20-800 (200d4) hit points of damage.
A middling power source like a robot would be somewhere in between.

The power sources are not destroyed by being drained.
Thy are only damaged if they are in the explosion range.
Robots and power plants are shut down unless hardened to such attacks.

=== Land Scraper

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iii-hardware:CH45_Grenades.adoc#_energy_grenade[Energy Grenade]
Area of Effect:: 150h x 150h x 10h
Damage:: 12-480 (12d4 x 10)
Wate:: 25kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 250000

Sends a lazer sheet parallel to the ground, travelling with the contours of the terrain, damaging all targets along the way.
This bomb is also called a trench clearer.

=== Bomb 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iii-hardware:CH45_Grenades.adoc#_fragmentation_grenade[Fragmentation Grenade]
Area of Effect:: 20h

This is the standard drop from the plane, hide in the car type bomb.
Bringing peace and liberty to innocent civilians everywhere.

//+++<figure id="attachment_9637" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9637" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[.size-medium.wp-image-9637] image::https://i0.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bomb_short_fuse-300x300.png?resize=300%2C300[studiostoks stock illustration modified HM,300]+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-9637" class="wp-caption-text">+++Bad fuse choice for a nuclear device.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

=== Nuclear Device 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iii-hardware:CH45_Grenades.adoc#_fusion_grenade[Fusion Grenade]
Area of Effect:: 200h
Damage:: 100-1200 (10d12 x 10)
Wate:: 42kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 10000

This is the favourite terran device for preserving peace through assured immolation.
What mad alien race would invent such a sick and twisted weapon?

.*Nuclear Device Areas of Effect*
* 200h tiny and small sized personas disintegrate
* 200h medium, large, and gigantic personas take 100-1200 (10d12 x 10) hit points
* 300h immolation 
* 400h blinding flash
* 600h radiation attack

.*Immolation*
Any flammable object within 300 hexes of the epicenter catches fire.
This includes personas as well as equipment.
Anything ignited by the grenade will burn until extinguished.
This results in burn damage every unit of being on fire.

.*Blinding*
Any personas within 400 hexes has a chance of being blinded.
The chance of being blinded is 1/2% per point of damage.
This attack affects both organic and inorganic personas and devices.
Vision will be restored in 1-10 (1d10) minutes.

.*Radiation*
Any target within 600 hexes is subject to a lethal radiation attack.
The intensity of the attack is 25.

The effects of a nuclear device are cumulative.
Consider a persona that is within 200 hexes taking 600 HPS of damage.
First she subtracts 600 HPS from HPS Total (hahahah).
She catches fire, is blinded and suffers a 25 intensity radiation attack.

.*Residual Radiation*
For effect the ref can make the 200 hex area of effect a lingering radiation zone.
The radiation intensity decreases from 25 by one point per week.
There will always be radiation anomaly detected at the blast site.

=== Nerve Bomb 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iii-hardware:CH45_Grenades.adoc#_gas_grenade[Gas Grenade]
Area of Effect:: 260h
Damage:: Varies 
Wate:: 25kg
EXPS:: 275 
Value:: 22500

The nerve bomb discharges a dense mist of poisons.
The nerve agents are both contact, and respiratory poisons.
All organic targets must roll vs poison attack or suffer the described affect.
The gas's intensity will vary from 4-24 (4d6).

The cloud of gas will remain and be poisonous for 1 day per point of intensity.
Prevailing winds may affect the duration, and intensity of the gas cloud.

include::ROOT:partial$CH44_Table_Gas_Type.adoc[]

=== Gravitas 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iii-hardware:CH45_Grenades.adoc#_gravruptor_grenade[Gravruptor Grenade]
Area of Effect:: 250h
Damage:: Special
Wate:: 50kg
EXPS:: 250
Value:: 300000

The gravitas generates 1-10 (1d10) gravities of anomalous attraction.
The gravitas bomb produces an instantaneous burst of random acceleration.
The bomb will either fling targets  into the air or crush them into the ground.
Newtonian physics conveniently need not apply.
Objects greater than 100 tonnes in wate are not affected by the bomb's attack.

There is a 75% chance that the gravitas bomb will add 1-10g in the area of effect.
Targets crash to the ground, weapons are torn from digits, and vehicles grind into the dirt.
This pressing problem inflicts 1 to 12 (1d12) hit points in damage per extra gravity
A persona need not hit the ground or be crushed it is the acceleration that hurts.
For example, 3g would smash targets into the ground for 3-36 (3d12) hit points of damage.

The remaining 25% of the time the gravitas bomb flings everything into the sky.
The acceleration inflicts 1 to 12 (1d12) hit points in damage per extra gravity.
The targets will rise 1h per gravity generated.
They then have to deal with falling damage from that height. 
For example, a 5g attack would inflict 5-60 (5d12) hit points of damage.
Then the personas will fall 5 hexes which usually inflicts 5d4 hit points in damage.

In zero gravity (zog) the targets will fly away from the epicenter of the blast.
The gravitas bomb inflicts the usual acceleration damage (1d12 per gravity).
The new movement rate will be 1 h/u per 2 points of damage generated by the bomb.

=== Junk Yard 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iii-hardware:CH45_Grenades.adoc#_magnetic_disruptor_grenade[Magnetic Disruptor Grenade]
Area of Effect:: 150h
Damage:: Special
Wate:: 37kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 112500

The junk yard bomb acts like an instantaneous super magnet. 
When detonated this bomb attracts loose items towards it's detonation hex.
For example, everything inorganic within 150h will fly towards the epicenter.
These high speed projectiles smash into any persona within the area of effect.
The further out from the epicenter the target is the less damage is delivered.
So a persona 150h out from the epicenter would take 1d4 of damage.
A persona in the target hex would take 150d4.
The targets closest to the detonation are being hit with more hurtling stuff.

Anything loose will be violently drawn towards the epicenter. 
This includes anything less than 500kg
The junk yard bomb will create an instantaneous junkyard.
It will attract anything inorganic: metals, alloys, plastic, wood, etc.
Artifacts are left destroyed in a mound resembling an instantaneous junk yard.
Unless the terrain is intentionally completely barren there will be stuff to attract.

Typically the planet is the nearest and largest object. 
In zero gravity the bomb will attach to the largest object within range.
If there is no reference object the junk yard bomb will create a satellite of junk.

=== Space Modulator 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iii-hardware:CH45_Grenades.adoc#_molecular_disruptor_grenade[Molecular Disruptor Grenade]
Area of Effect:: Special
Damage:: Special
Wate:: 30kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 500000

Simply put everything within the blast radius is destroyed.
No saving throw.
Every thing in the effect radius will take 8d8 hit points of damage.
There is absolutely no cover offered.

A space modulator bomb is a temperamental disintegration bomb.
It is the classic total annihilation device of mad scientists the universe over. 
When detonated this bomb converts matter into a warm, seething cloud.
The problem is that neither the bomber, nor the bomb, has any idea how much matter is about to be disrupted.
When a space modulator bomb is used the amount of destruction is randomly determined.

.*Damage*
The damage area of effect inflicts 8-64 (8d8) hit points of damage. 
The size of the damage area of effect is rolled on the Disruption Event Table. 
Damage is caused by slivers of disintegration that escpe from the bomb.
These slivers punch microscopic holes through anything in the damage area of effect.

.*Disintegration*
The disintegration area of effect utterly destroys any target within it. 
Any matter within this area of effect is transformed into homogenous gas.
There is no explosion, no noise, just a giant cloud of effervescent warm gas.
The effect of this on matter is devastating, and final.
All personas, equipment, terrain, and good ideas are utterly destroyed.

include::ROOT:partial$CH45_Table_Modulator_Event.adoc[]

=== Jumping Jack Blast

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iii-hardware:CH45_Grenades.adoc#_multiple_explosive_grenade[Multiple Explosive Grenade]
Area of Effect:: Special
Damage:: Special
Wate:: 45kg
EXPS:: 250
Value:: 25000

The jumping jack blast will detonate multiple times with unpredictable effect.
There will be a 1 to 10 (1d10) unit pause between explosions.
The new epicenter will be 20 to 120 (2d6 x 10) hexes away from the last one.

include::ROOT:partial$CH44_Table_Jumping_Jack_Pattern.adoc[]

=== Cremator 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iii-hardware:CH45_Grenades.adoc#_napalm_grenade[Napalm Grenade]
Area of Effect:: 40h x 160h
Damage:: 60-600 (60d10)
Wate:: 39kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 50000

When discharged the bomb launches itself into the air, and sprays napalm along its path.
Additional burning damage will usually be irrelevant to all but the freshest combat robot.
The path will burn for 20 to 80 units after the attack, inflicting 20 to 240  (20d12) HPS in burning damage each unit.

=== Diversionizer 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iii-hardware:CH45_Grenades.adoc#_pyrotechnic_grenade[Pyrotechnic Grenade]
Area of Effect:: 100h
Damage:: None
Wate:: 10kg
EXPS:: 100
Value:: 8750

The diversionizer is a shock and awe weapon.
The bomb can be composed smoke, sonic, flash or any combination.
While it may not be directly lethal it's effects can result in fatalities.

include::ROOT:partial$CH45_Table_Pyro_Combo.adoc[]

Smoke:: 
The diversionizer's smoke attack fills the area of effect with very dense smoke.
The smoke will last for 1-10 (1d10) hours.
For a fancy smoke colour jump to the <<_bomb_colour,Colour Table>>.

Flash:: 
The diversionizer's flash bomb will  blind any target that has optical sensors.
The sensors (eyes, cameras) will remain inoperative for 1 to 10 hours.
There is a saving roll versus intensity 3-24 (3d8) poison.

Sonic:: 
the diversionizer's sonic boom deliver a painful eardrum numbing howl on discharge.
Any audio receptors in the area of effect are deafened by the attack.
Total deafness lasts 1 to 10 hours, followed by days of impaired audio.
There is no saving throw for the diversionizer's sonic attack.

=== Neutron Bomb 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iii-hardware:CH45_Grenades.adoc#_radiation_grenade[Radiation Grenade]
Area of Effect:: 240h
Damage:: 30-180 (30d6)
Wate:: 55kg
EXPS:: 200
Value:: 25000

This hater of all things organic does not damage structures or robots.
A neutron bomb bathes everything in the area of effect with destructive radiation.
Only those organics hardened to radiation can avoid the initial wave of damage.
Anything that survives the initial attack then must roll versus intensity 25 radiation.

The site hot for 25 years.
Dropping one level of radiation intensity per year.
The site will remain radioactively anomalous forever.
What mad alien race would invent such a sick and twisted device?

=== Sky Breaker 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iii-hardware:CH45_Grenades.adoc#_skylighter_grenade[Skylighter Grenade]
Area of Effect:: 800h x 600h
Damage:: 50-500 (40d10)
Wate:: 70kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 275000

The sky breaker combines a massive serving of destruction with shock and awe.
The initial detonation fires straight up apparently having no effect.
Then 20 to 60 units later the area of effect is hailed with with shards of iridescent glowing ice.
This grenade depends on complex meteorological mechanisms.
This grenade is useless if used indoors, underwater, in zero gravity or in a vacuum.

=== Torc Bomb 

[horizontal]

Value:: 450000

The torc bomb is the anti-force field bomb.
A torc bomb does no damage unless the target is within a force field.
The bomb affects any force field makes contact with the radius of the torc bomb.
Any tactical, personal, robotic or civic powered force field will instantly be exhausted.
A force field powered by a renewable power plant is permanently disabled.
The torc bomb will temporarily shut down a naval forcefield. 
The torc bomb will have no effect what so ever on force fields greater than 240 hexes in radius.
The bomb may create a temporary hole in giant force fields to assist the story.

The collapse of the shield delivers 120-1440 (12d12 x 10) hit points of damage.
The damage is only delivered to targets inside the force field. 

=== Lazer Cover 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iii-hardware:CH43_Aerosols.adoc#_anti_lazer_aerosol[Anti Lazer Aerosol]
Area of Effect:: 70h

Damage:: 50 to 600 (50d6)
Wate:: 42kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 2250000


The bot bomb turns inorganic matter into an opaque, iridescent, cloud of freezing gas.
Any equipment, vehicles, armour, computers or robots within 20h is destroyed.
This includes persona robots.
A persona robot gets a  roll versus intensity 13 to 28 (10+3d6) poison or disappears.

Everything within 60h of detonation will take damage from the freezing gas. 
This includes all organic personas, and any inorganic ones that avoided disintegration.
The freezing gas cloud inflicts 50 to 600 (50d6) hit points of damage.
If an organic persona is in the detonation hex of this weapon they too can disintegrate.
An organic personas suffering a direct hit has a 42% chance of  disappearing along with their equipment.
A persona gets a  roll versus intensity 13 to 28 (10+3d6) poison.

Base Weapon:: xref:iii-hardware:CH43_Aerosols.adoc#_foam_aerosol[Foam Aerosol]
Area of Effect:: 160h
Damage:: None
Wate:: 75kg
EXPS:: 100
Value:: 1237

The foam bomb instantly covers its area of effect with a rapidly hardening blob of foam.
The foam pad is 10h deep.
The foam hardens in 20 units. 
Anything still within the foam after 20 units will be permanently trapped.
The foam is thick and slows movement by 1/2. 
Anything flying is grounded by the foam.

Once cured the foam is easily cut away.
However trapped personas are completely helpless.
At no time are personas at risk of suffocation. 
A more likely death is dehydration and starvation.

This is also called an insulator or homemaker.

=== Tracker Bomb

Area of Effect:: 500h
Damage:: None
Wate:: 70kg
EXPS:: 100
Value:: 2000

The cover bomb renders all senses completely useless.
Virtually all sensors are dulled through lack of stimuli.
This includes eyes, ears, touch, cameras, microphones, etc. 
While not blinded nothing can be seen, yelling is futile, and everything feels cool to the touch.
Any attacks made are in a random direction, even if the target recently brushed against the attacker.
Movement is random, unless the persona has some form of directional sense.
The suspension will remain cohesive for 10-160 (1d6 x 10) days.
Getting lost within the cover bomb area of effect  is a real possibility.

=== Diffusion Bomb

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iii-hardware:CH43_Aerosols.adoc#_molecular_diffusion_aerosol[Molecular Diffusion Aerosol]

Value:: 35000

The toxin bomb is both selective and lethal.
A combined nerve gas and respiratory poison is spread through the area of effect.
Whatever type of creature is poisoned by this aerosol must make a save versus intensity 2 to 24 poison, or die.
Personas that survive the killing attack will still take poison damage.
The targeted persona type will be repulsed by the lingering residue.
The repellant effect will last for 1-3 (1d3) weeks.
The Poisoned Persona Table determines what is affected by the personacide.

include::ROOT:partial$CH45_Table_Poisoned_Personas.adoc[]

Value:: 2500

The bug bomb is a super sized repellent, and is the pacifist's version of the toxin bomb.
Targets repelled by the bomb must save versus intensity 13-28 (3d6+10).
A failed saving roll indicates that the persona will irrationally run, fly or hop away.
If the persona saves versus the repellent they still must leave the area of effect.
Any recursion into the repellent area of effect indicates another save is required.
The residue will work repel targets for 1-6 (1d6) weeks.

include::ROOT:partial$CH45_Table_Repelled_Personas.adoc[]

=== Air Raid Siren

Value:: 3750

The ear splitting siren will wail for 2 to 8 minutes.
This attack will deafen all audio systems for for 1 to 10 days.
This includes organic ears and inorganic microphones.
There is 1% chance per day of deafness that the hearing loss becomes permanent.
There is no saving throw.

=== Smog Machine 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iii-hardware:CH43_Aerosols.adoc#_smoke_aerosol[Smoke Aerosol]
Area of Effect:: 240h
Damage:: None
Wate:: 50kg
EXPS:: 50
Value:: 5000

The smog machine creates a gigantic immobile pall of a particular colour.
The cloud will disperse over 10 to 80 (1d8 x 10) weeks.
The dense smog can be removed by excavation equipment.
If the range penalties are being applied the smog counts as opaque.
The colour of the smog will match the colour of the casing of the bomb.
To determine the smog colour and pattern jump to <<_bomb_colour,Bomb Colour>>.

=== World Wide Web 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iii-hardware:CH43_Aerosols.adoc#_web_aerosol[Web Aerosol]
Area of Effect:: 160h x 20h
Damage:: None
Wate:: 50kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 50000

The world wide web bomb splatters the swath of effect with super adhesive goo. 
Anything caught in the area of effect will be trapped until the webby mess dissipates.
Any persona that saunters into the messy web will instantly become entrapped.
Targets are trapped for 20-160 (2d8 x 10) minutes until the web decomposes.
A persona can attempt subtle movements, such as pulling a gun trigger, activating an aerosol, or taking a pharmaceutical. 
To be successful requires difficult DEX (1d20) roll.

Struggling leads to a chance of suffocation. 
If a persona begins to struggle there is a 1% chance of suffocating in the web.

Procedures such as burning, dissolving or disintegrating the web will have varying chances of success. 
Each attempt to free a persona from the will has a chance of trapping the rescuer.
A failed difficult DEX (1d20) roll by a rescuer indicates they are now trapped as well.

The colour of the web will be the same as the colour of the aerosol canister.
To determine the web colour and pattern jump to <<_bomb_colour,Bomb Colour>>.

This aerosol statistic does not apply to bombs, even if the bomb is modelled after an aerosol.
When a bomb is detonated, it destroys itself, and its area of effect reaches out around it.
It also should be obvious that bombs cannot be thrown any great distance.

=== Area of Effect 
The area of effect operates similarly to the area of effect of grenades, and aerosols.
The only difference is that a bomb's area of effect radius is 20 times greater than its base type.
All incidental area of effect radii are also multiplied by 20.
E.g., the fusion bomb has an area of effect that inflicts damage, one that blinds, one that immolates, and one that irradiates.
The radius of each of these effects is multiplied by 20.
Those bombs modelled after weapons that have a swath attack, will also have a swath attack as a bomb.
The dimensions of the swath attack are increased 20 times.

The cover granted to a bomb attack must be much more substantial than that needed to impede a grenade.
For instance cover from a grenade attack could be offered by the wall of a house, or the corner of a building.
In the case of a bomb, only a military bunker may be able to protect the target.
Bombs are deadly.
They are designed to destroy large areas effectively and economically.

=== Damage 
Any damage that the base weapon inflicts is multiplied by 10.
This is the factor that makes bombs so incredibly deadly, because even the most trivial damage amounts are multiplied to killer proportions.
If the referee feels that a non-lethal base grenade, or aerosol, has been made too deadly by the change in damage, she may feel free to alter it.

=== Wate 
A bomb will have a wate 25 times greater than its grenade, or aerosol counterpart.

=== EXPS 
Bombs are worth the same number of EXPS of the grenade or aerosol that they are modelled after.

=== Value 
The value of a bomb is 50 times that of its base aerosol, or grenade type.




=== Detonator 
A bomb's detonator is the nitty gritty of the device.
Unlike grenades and aerosols, a bomb's detonators is *NOT* designed with persona safety in mind.
The bombs have radio detonators, fuses, or some other form of long range triggering device which allows for user safety.
Once the detonator is activated the bomb will explode spreading death all about itself.
Fooling with a bomb's detonator could very easily annihilate and entire expedition.
There is a 75% chance that a bomb's detonator will be detached from the bomb itself.
Safety first.

=== Description 
Bombs have shapes and colours the same as grenades do.
Even if the bomb has an aerosol effect, it will have one of the bomb shapes generated in this section.
