Equine is the short form for Hominidae Homo Equus.
Homo Equus are humanoid horse people. 
Equines can choose to resemble any hoofed animal: Clydesdale, gazelle, elephant, cow, goat, unicorn, giraffe, etc.
Regardless of their four legged counterparts equine are bipedal humanoids.
Equines have horse like heads, hooves for feet, fly-swatting tails. Possibly their cured skin makes good leather.
The mythical unicorn can teleport from place to place.
A Homo Equus unicorn could not teleport without having a teleport mutation.

== Run and Jump
The equines are fast.
This means all equines are fast. 
Cows, deer, horses, and goats all enjoy the gallop ability.
All ursidae get a bonus of +3 h/u on their movement rate.
So an equine with a move of 5 h/u would move at 8 h/u.
This is not a gallop and is their new natural movement rate.

=== Gallop
Equines have can also gallop.
This a full out clippity clop sprint. 
An equine cannot do any other physical activity while galloping.
For example, the equine cannot attack while moving, but could use a mental mutation. 
When galloping equines move at 2 and Â½ times their normal movement rate.
If the equine's movement rate was 8 h/u she could gallop at the amazing 20 h/u.

=== Jumping
Equines are also fantastic jumpers.
Jumping abilities cannot be combined with galloping.
Equine can leap horizontally 2 h per 8 points of PSTR.
Equine can jump vertically 1.5 times their Hite.
Jumping and leaping are combined into the normal movement rate.
An equine can perform any task, including combat, while jumping and leaping.
During combat time the persona could leap or jump once per unit.
