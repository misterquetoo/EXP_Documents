[.s2]#This is the chapter devoted to technological area of effect weapons.
The classic area of effect weapon is #[.s3]#the grenade, and the area of effect weapon of the #[.s4]#future (or distant past), is the aerosol.
Each #[.s5]#weapon type is discussed in the following #[.s6]#paragraphs.
#[.s8]#When a player is generating toys #[.s9]#for her persona she should use Table 45.1: Grenade or Aerosol Type.
For #[.s3]#convenience there tables devoted to just grenade types and and another devoted to just  aerosol types+++<i>+++.
+++</i>+++These tables should only be #[.s8]#used by the referee when she specifically needs either a grenade or and aerosol.
The aerosol or grenade table is balanced for the generation of initial TOYs, but the aerosol and grenade only tables are not.
#

[.s6]#Grenades, and aerosols, generally act the #[.s7]#same instant that they are detonated.
Only under #certain circumstances may a grenade explode later [.s8]#than one unit after being thrown.
Understanding Grenade and Aerosol combat in http://expgame.com/?page_id=304[Chapter 30] will be very helpful if you are using artifacts from this chapter#

== Grenade or Aerosol {.p4}

This is where a persona will generate an area of effect artifact when generating something from the TOY system.

== [.s6]#Grenades# {.p5}

[.s3]#A grenade is any hand, claw, or paw thrown area #[.s8]#of effect weapon.
Grenades are remarkable for #[.s3]#their ease of use, and even more remarkable for #[.s10]#their deadliness.
The grenade is particularly #unintelligent, and will damage expedition members [.s10]#as indiscriminately as opponents.
No normal #[.s11]#armour type can stop the damage of a grenade, and #[.s3]#anything caught within the area of effect will be damaged.
There is only slim chance that a target #[.s11]#will be able to avoid damage, and that is when the #[.s7]#grenade is a dud.
There is only a 1 in 1000 chance #[.s10]#that a grenade will be a dud.
#[.s7]#Once #[.s11]#a grenade is discharged (exploded), it is irretrievably #[.s7]#lost.
#

=== [.s1]#Range# {.p40}

[.s8]#Grenades consume the hex that they #[.s7]#explode in, and must be thrown a safe distance to avoid damaging the user.
The range of a grenade #[.s11]#depends entirely on the thrower, and is equal to her PSTR#[.s27]#* *#in hexes.
For grenade misses the grenade will [.s3]#land in a random nearby hex as determined in Grenade and Aerosol combat in http://expgame.com/?page_id=304[Chapter 30].#

=== Area Of Effect {.p41}

[.s9]#For all grenades, the area of effect #[.s8]#represents the radius of the sphere in which all #[.s10]#occupants are affected.
E.g., a fragmentation #[.s7]#grenade has an area of effect of 1 hex.
Anything in #[.s3]#an adjacent hex to the one in which the grenade #[.s6]#exploded will be damaged.
Also, anything less than two hexes above the grenade will also be #[.s11]#damaged.
All of these area effect blasts can include #[.s3]#expedition members.#

=== [.s1]#Damage# {.p44}

This is the hit point range that is inflicted upon any [.s7]#target caught within the area of effect of the #[.s9]#grenade.
Wherever the damage has #[.s7]#been omitted, the grenade has some other #[.s8]#special effect.
Remember that damage is rolled #[.s3]#once, and applied to all targets within the area of #[.s7]#effect.
Unless specified there is no save versus area of effect attacks.#

=== [.s1]#Wate# {.p45}

[.s7]#This is the wate of an unspent grenade, or aerosol.
#[.s3]#An empty aerosol canister has a wate 10% of its original wate.
E.g., 2 kg aerosol is reduced to an empty 200 gm canister.#

=== EXPS {.p44}

[.s8]#Experience points for identifying a grenade, or #[.s10]#aerosol, are earned the same as for any other #[.s3]#artifact.
An equivalent experience point value can #[.s7]#be earned after either weapon has been discharged, #[.s3]#but these EXPS#[.s31]#* *#[.s3]#can only be earned by the firer.
#

=== [.s1]#Value# {.p44}

[.s7]#The value of a grenade, or aerosol, is the value #of one charge.
In some cases aerosols can generate [.s5]#more than one charge, but even with these #[.s8]#modifications such aerosols still have the same #value.

=== Amount {.p47}

[.s8]#The referee must roll a d6 to #[.s3]#determine the number of grenades that are found #in a cache.
For powerful campaign altering grenades one will suffice.

=== [.s14]#Trigger# {.p11}

[.s6]#To make the subject of #[.s7]#grenades a little more confusing there are several different types of fuses.
For the convenience of the #[.s3]#ref 9 out of 10 grenades are detonated by contact #[.s6]#with the target hex, or any substantially solid #[.s11]#object along its path.
All other grenades will have #[.s3]#timers, and will explode 0 to 3 units after being #thrown.
[.s9]#Before a grenade will detonate, it must be #[.s3]#triggered, and thrown.
A list of several different #[.s8]#trigger types are given on Table 45.2: Grenade #[.s6]#Trigger+++<i>+++.
+++</i>+++The trigger types do not require explanation, and simply indicate what must be #[.s9]#done to activate the grenade.
For example, an #[.s7]#inertia trigger is activated when the grenade goes #through a throwing motion, and a twist trigger will [.s7]#active when some device is twisted on the grenade.#

=== Description {.p16}

[.s8]#Not all grenades are #[.s7]#created equal, and even grenades of the same type #[.s6]#may have different shapes and colours.
These #[.s7]#variations have arisen from the fact that different #[.s3]#companies build their grenades differently, and even the same company may have packaged the same grenade differently from one military order #[.s7]#to the next.
Grenades have no identifying markings #[.s3]#at all.
Identification must be made by feel, and #[.s11]#other indicators.
Roll once on Table 44.1: Bomb #[.s7]#Shape+++<i>+++, +++</i>+++and once on Table 44.3: Colour Bomb__.__#

[table id=434 /]

[table id=435 /] + [table id=437 /]

[table id=436 /]

== Grenade Type {.p4}

If a the referee or persona only requires a grenade artifact roll on the table below.
Otherwise consult Table 45.1: Grenade or Aerosol above

[table id=474 /]

== [.s32]#1) Big Bertha Grenade# {.p35}

[table id=477 /]

[.s8]#The big bertha is a massive concussion grenade.
#[.s18]#All targets within the area of effect are automatically #[.s7]#knocked down.
Any persona, or target, caught #[.s9]#within 12 hexes of the epicenter must make a #recovery roll (see http://expgame.com/?page_id=267#recovery-roll[recovery roll][.s11]#), or be stunned for 1-10 units.
All medium, or #[.s10]#smaller, sized creatures within a 15 hex blast #radius must win a normal (d20) [.s36]#DEX attribute #roll, or be knocked down.
[.s7]#The effects of the big bertha are cumulative, #[.s11]#so a target 8 hexes from the target hex would take #[.s3]#damage, be knocked down, and have to make a recovery roll or be stunned.#

== [.s1]#2) Chemical Explosive Grenade# {.p35}

[table id=478 /]

[.s7]#A chemical explosive grenade is the more typical #[.s18]#concussion, fragmentation device that is commonly #[.s6]#chucked about during war pix, and punk rock #[.s8]#concerts.
The chemical explosive is the bigger #[.s3]#sister of the Fragmentation grenade.#

== 3) Corrosive Grenade {.p36}

[table id=479 /]

[.s6]#The corrosive grenade bathes the area of effect #[.s44]#with acids, alkalies, or non-neutralizing #[.s6]#combinations of both.
The corrosive grenade&#8217;s #[.s5]#contents are highly volatile, but neutralize #[.s4]#themselves almost automatically on organic #surfaces.

[.s11]#The corrosive nature of this ejected concoction #[.s7]#will continue to eat away at inorganic materials--#such as: metals, plastic, rubber, etc.--unless washed [.s3]#off.
If items such as armour, weapons, or robots #[.s7]#are left to corrode they will take an additional 2-20 #hit points of damage for each of the continuing 1-8 [.s3]#units of reaction.
E.g., an unwashed robot could take an additional 2-20 HPS for 4 units after the initial blast.
#[.s3]#Corrosive grenades are also known as acid #[.s8]#baths, and Draino bombs.#

== 4) Cryoblast Grenade {.p4}

[table id=480 /]

[.s8]#The cryoblast grenade subjects everything in its #[.s10]#area of effect to a blast of freezing cold.
The #grenade is not only capable of freezing things solid, [.s3]#but it can trap targets in the ice that it produces.
#[.s11]#Medium, or smaller, sized targets have a % chance, #[.s3]#equal to the damage inflicted, of being trapped in #[.s6]#the ice.
So a medium sized beasty that took 19 #[.s18]#points of damage would have a 19% chance of being #[.s3]#frozen immobile.
The cryoblast grenade can also #[.s3]#freeze swords in scabbards, render buttons frozen, #jam weapons, etc.
The cryoblast is also known as a cryofrag, a berg bomb, or a rinkmaker.

== 5) Energy Drain Grenade {.p41}

[table id=481 /]

[.s3]#An energy drain grenade will suck the life out of #[.s9]#nearby potential energy stores (batteries), and #[.s3]#then self destruct.
Any batteries within a 10 hex #[.s6]#radius will be instantly devoid of charge.
The #[.s3]#grenade will then shower a smaller 3 hex area of #[.s7]#effect with its fragments, and kinetic energy.
This explosion will inflict 1d4 hit points in damage for #[.s10]#every battery drained.
Therefore, if a hapless #[.s3]#target has three batteries in her weapon, 4 in her backpack, and a nearby expedition member has a #[.s11]#total of 9 on her person, the grenade would explode--#[.s3]#in 0 to 3 units--inflicting 16d4 of damage to all within 3 hexes.#

[.s7]#The energy drain grenade cannot affect robot #[.s3]#batteries, or power plants.
Psionic batteries get a save vs.
mental attack before losing a battery life.
#[.s8]#The psionic attack strength of the grenade attack is 0.
Note that an energy drain grenade could kill #[.s7]#a persona using psionic batteries by reducing her #[.s3]#MSTR #[.s50]#to #[.s3]#0.
#The energy drain grenade is also known as an [.s3]#Amp-ire grenade, or a Never-ready.#

== [.s18]#6) Energy Grenade# {.p86}

[table id=482 /]

[.s10]#The energy grenade emits a controlled lazer #[.s7]#explosion of the given volume (15h x 15h x 1h).
Regardless of the terrain in which the grenade is #[.s11]#employed, it will always occupy the given volume.
#[.s8]#Note that the 1 hex component will always run #[.s3]#parallel to gravity.
The grenade&#8217;s blast area will#[.s46]#* *#[.s7]#race along corridors, through open doors, around #[.s3]#corners, and down escalators.
Using this weapon #[.s11]#in unfamiliar terrain could have its effects hurtling #[.s8]#directly back at the thrower.
#[.s11]#The energy grenade is also known as an anti-#[.s8]#trench grenade, or a mouser.#

== [.s17]#7) Exploding Pin Grenade# {.p88}

[table id=483 /]

[.s6]#The exploding pin grenade is a rather sadistic #[.s8]#version of a micro grenade launcher.
When an #[.s3]#EPG goes off, it showers the 4 hex area of effect with tiny pins.
These tiny pins can stick into the hardest of alloys (AR less than 1000).
When ever #a pin hits, it will immediately explode inflicting the d6 damage described above.
The key is the number of pins which stick into a target, and this depends [.s7]#solely on the target&#8217;s size.
Use Table 45.7, +++<i>+++Pin Hit +++</i>+++#[.s9]#to determine how many pins will explode for #damage.

[table id=484 /]

== 8) Fragmentation Grenade {.p24}

[table id=485 /]

[.s11]#A fragmentation grenade is your common everyday #[.s4]#run of the mill shrapnel grenade.
These are #commonly called frags, or grenades.

== 9) Fusion Grenade {.p101}

[table id=486 /]

[.s4]#A fusion grenade unleashes a micro nuclear #[.s3]#explosion.
In addition to damage from the initial #[.s7]#nuclear blast, there are a host of other nasty effects #[.s3]#that increase the deadliness of the weapon.
Any flammable object within 15 hexes of the epicenter #[.s7]#has a % chance (equal the damage of the blast) of immolating.
Anything ignited by the grenade will #[.s8]#burn until extinguished.
Any organic creatures #[.s10]#within 20 hexes of the epicenter not actively #[.s3]#shielding its eyes will have a % chance (equal to 1/ #[.s9]#2 the blast damage) of being blinded for 1-10 #[.s3]#minutes.
And lastly, any target within 30 hexes of #[.s7]#the epicenter is subject to a radiation attack of an #[.s3]#intensity equal to 1/10 of the blast damage (http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#saving-throw[See Saving Throws]).#

[.s6]#Any reader should have noticed that this is not a close combat weapon, and the even more #[.s10]#observant readers have noticed that a fusion #[.s8]#grenade cannot be thrown without having some effect on the attacker.#

[.s55]#The effects of a fusion grenade are #[.s3]#cumulatively lethal.
Any target caught within the #[.s7]#10 hex radius would first take damage, let&#8217;s say a #[.s3]#modest roll of 60 hit points of damage.
Then there #[.s11]#is a 60% chance a catching on fire, a 30% chance of #[.s8]#being blinded, and then an intensity 6 radiation #[.s3]#attack.
Only the most hardy of souls are going to survive this.#

For effect the ref can make the 10 hex area of [.s8]#effect a lingering radiation zone of an intensity #[.s3]#equal to 1/10 of the blast damage.
The radiation #zone&#8217;s intensity level will decrease by one point per [.s8]#hour, day, or week, depending on how dirty the grenade was.
#[.s6]#Fusion grenades are also known as micro-#[.s3]#nukes, and tactical nukes.#+++<figure id="attachment_9837" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9837" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i2.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Copy-of-stormy-storm-trooper-300x174.jpg?resize=300%2C174[Last Enemy by H.

== [.s11]#10) Gas Grenade# {.p35}

[table id=487 /]

[.s11]#The gas grenade discharges a toxic combination of #[.s7]#contact, and respiratory poisons in a dense enough mist to affect any organic creatures within it.
The #[.s3]#cloud of gas will dissipate in 1-8 unit All targets #[.s7]#must save vs.
poison attack for every unit that they #are within the area of effect.
Prevailing winds may [.s8]#affect the duration, and intensity of the gas cloud #[.s3]#if the ref sees fit.
The gas&#8217;s intensity will vary from 4-24 (4d6).
This value is generated once for the #[.s7]#entire cloud, and will determine if it is a strong or #weak gas.

The type of gas ejected by the grenade can be [.s8]#rolled on Table 45.4: Gas Type+++<i>+++.
+++</i>+++This table will explain the gas&#8217;
effect on targets, and how long #[.s3]#these effects last.#

[table id=488 /]

== [.s19]#11) Gravruptor Grenade# {.p86}

[table id=489 /]

[.s7]#The gravruptor grenade generates 1-6 random #[.s11]#gravities of anomalous attraction.
The effect will either smash targets into the ground, throw them #[.s18]#high into the air, or fling them off into space.
The #[.s7]#gravruptor grenade produces an instantaneous #[.s8]#burst of random acceleration, and newtonian #[.s18]#physics conveniently need not be applied.
Objects #[.s11]#greater than 10 tonnes in wate are not affected by #this grenade&#8217;s attack.

[.s11]#There is a 50% chance that the gravruptor #[.s7]#grenade will add 1-6 +++<i>+++g +++</i>+++to the local terrain.
The #[.s18]#effects of this should be obvious, as targets crash to #[.s7]#the ground, weapons are torn from grasps, and #[.s11]#vehicles grind into the dirt.
This pressing problem #[.s18]#will also inflict damage to all targets in the area of #[.s11]#effect.
This damage is 1 to 12 hit points in damage #[.s7]#per extra gravity.
E.g., 3 gravities would smash #[.s17]#targets into the ground for 3-36 hit points of damage.#

When the gravruptor grenade is reversing [.s11]#gravity there will be an acceleration of 1-6 gravities #[.s8]#in a direction opposite to the present gravity #[.s18]#direction.
The general effect is that things go flying into the air.
All items are lifted 1 hex in the air per #[.s7]#anomalous gravity.
There is no damage inflicted #[.s18]#on the initial toss up, but the subsequent trip down #[.s3]#from 1-6 hexes will inflict substantial damage.
#[.s18]#There will be 1-6 hit points of damage inflicted per #[.s3]#hex that the target falls through.
If the targets #should hit a ceiling, or some other such covering, [.s18]#on the way up they would take 1 to 6 hit points per #gravity inflicted.

[.s7]#All of the above effects are described for a normal gravity world.
What effects this grenade #[.s17]#has on high gravity and low gravity planets depends #entirely on the ref.

[.s18]#The effects of this weapon in zero gravity are #[.s3]#described here because this is the environment #[.s7]#that the weapon was primarily designed for.
All #[.s18]#targets are subjected to 1 to 6 hit points of damage per gravity of acceleration, and fly away from the grenade&#8217;s target hex at 1 h/u for every 2 points of #[.s6]#damage.
So if a target in deep space took 5 #[.s11]#gravities, inflicting 16 hit points of damage, she&#8217;d #[.s7]#fly away at 8 h/u until stopped.#

[.s18]#The gravruptor grenade is also known as a #[.s11]#downer, and a jump bomb.#

== [.s17]#12) Magnetic Disruptor Grenade# {.p116}

[table id=490 /]

[.s11]#The magnetic disruptor grenade will generate a #[.s18]#super attraction for a particular type of material.
Whatever the grenade attracts will hurtle towards #[.s7]#the epicenter of the area of effect at very high #[.s3]#speeds.
Nine times out of ten the grenade will #attract metals and alloys.
The remaining 10% of [.s19]#the time some other obscure material will be drawn #[.s8]#towards the grenade (flesh, plastic, lumber, concrete).
If there is dispute as to whether a #[.s18]#particular material is affected by the grenade then the #[.s3]#referee and player should consult the highly technical and well researched http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#sphincter-dice[Sphincter Dice] #[.s17]#described in chapter 16, Special Rolls.
For instance, #[.s3]#does this grenade affect the weapons that the #opponents are holding?

[.s7]#This grenade can have lethal effects, since #[.s17]#great big chunks of plastic, or metal, will be racing #[.s18]#across the area of effect.
The referee must decide #[.s11]#whether or not a persona is a potential target of flying debris.
If the grenade were detonated in a junk yard everyone would almost certainly take #[.s8]#maximum damage from the flying material.
#[.s11]#Deciding who is hit be the debris is determined by #[.s3]#the referee.
How much damage is inflicted is #determined by the wate of the debris.

If a persona is hit by flying debris, she will take at most 20d4, and at the least 1d4 hit points [.s18]#in damage.
Magnetically attracted junk will inflict #[.s11]#1d4 hit points per hex per unit that it is travelling.
#[.s32]#The wate of the object is divided into the arbitrary #[.s3]#number of 20 h/u per kg, and this will determine how fast and how dangerous the projectile is.
A 2 #[.s7]#kg projectile would inflict 10d4, and move at 10 h/ #[.s3]#u.
A 20 kg object would harmlessly tumble along #[.s32]#at 1 h/u, possibly inflicting a d4 of damage if it were #[.s3]#to roll over a sleeping target.
Objects that are less #[.s6]#than 1 kg in wate may move faster, but cannot #[.s8]#inflict more than 20d4 damage.
Objects greater #[.s6]#than 20 kg cannot move slower than 1 h/u, nor #[.s8]#inflict less than a d4 of damage.
Objects which have a wate greater than 500 kg will attract the #[.s9]#grenade instead of vice versa.
The user could #[.s3]#employ this grenade to attract herself towards a #[.s7]#space vehicle.#

A simpler way to determine the damage is each persona will randomly be subject to 1-20 (1d10) 1d4 in damage.

== [.s1]#13) Mini Grenade# {.p121}

[table id=491 /]

[.s6]#Mini grenades are so small and light that they #[.s8]#cannot be thrown far, and must hit the target to #[.s3]#inflict damage.
Because they are so diminutive in #[.s10]#size, mini grenade users may wish to throw a #[.s3]#handful of these micro explosives at their target.
#[.s8]#The persona can throw up to three mini grenades #[.s3]#in one handful.
The first grenade attacks at minus 50, the second at minus 75, and the third at minus 100.
Remember that the grenades only need to hit #[.s9]#the target, and not penetrate armour to inflict #[.s7]#damage.
Mini grenades are also known as pea grenades, [.s9]#or pill grenades.
High tech mini grenades can #[.s3]#become extremely small indeed.##

[table id=492 /]

[.s28]#*Mini Gas Grenades*:#[.s3]#There is a 10% chance that a mini grenade will have the effects of a gas #[.s7]#grenade, modelled after http://expgame.com/?page_id=337#10-gas[Gas Grenades, #10] in this #[.s6]#chapter.
Mini gas grenades do no damage, but #[.s8]#have an effect similar to one of the regular gas #[.s10]#grenades.
The area of effect for the, mini gas #[.s8]#grenade is no larger than the target hex in which it lands, and the attacker need only hit the target #[.s7]#hex as with a regular grenade.
Any targets caught #[.s3]#within this brief puff of gas need only make one #[.s7]#save vs poison, since the cloud dissipates the same #[.s8]#unit it appears.#

[.s28]#*Mini Pyrotechnic Grenades*:#[.s3]#There is also a 10% chance that mini grenades will function the #[.s9]#same as pyrotechnic grenades, modelled after #[.s3]#Pyrotechnic Grenades, #18 in this chapter.
Mini #[.s7]#pyrotechnic grenades do no damage, and function #[.s3]#identically to regular pyrotechnic grenades in all #[.s7]#respects.
The grenade user need only hit the target #[.s8]#hex that the grenade is aimed at.#

== [.s1]#14) Molecular Disruptor Grenade# {.p44}

[table id=493 /]

[.s21]#A molecular disruptor is a temperamental #disintegration grenade.
When it is discharged, it is [.s8]#capable of turning matter into a warm, seething #[.s7]#cloud.
The problem is that neither the thrower, nor #[.s9]#the grenade, has any idea how much matter is #[.s10]#about to be disrupted.
Each time a molecular #disruptor is used Table 45.10, [.s61]#+++<i>+++Extent ofDisruption, +++</i>+++#[.s3]#must be referred to to determine how devastating #[.s7]#the effect is.#

[.s11]#The table #[.s40]#+++<i>+++lists +++</i>+++#[.s11]#both damage and disintegration #[.s43]#values.
Damage is caused by thin slivers of #disintegrated matter, that punch microscopic holes [.s3]#through targets in the given area of effect, inflicting #[.s8]#8 to 64 (8d8) hit points in damage to all targets.
#[.s8]#Disintegration indicates that all matter--this #includes personas--has been turned into an effervescent cloud of warm gas.
The effect of this on matter is devastating, and final.
Any organic [.s11]#creatures caught in a disintegration area of effect #will be killed.

[.s3]#The molecular disruption grenade is also #[.s7]#known as a disintegration grenade.#

[table id=494 /]

== [.s1]#15) Multiple Explosive Grenade# {.p134}

[table id=495 /]

The multiple explosive grenade is the exploding [.s18]#cigar of lethal combat.
This grenade is thrown and #will explode like any other normal grenade, but [.s7]#that is where the similarities end.#

Once the first explosion has discharged its [.s7]#deadly casing, the grenade is flung into the air, only to land and explode again.
The successive #[.s18]#explosions will be 0 to 3 units apart, and 1 to 6 hexes #[.s7]#in a random facet direction from the previous #[.s18]#target hex.
There are three versions ofthis grenade, #[.s17]#use the Grenade Pattern Table to determine which #[.s18]#pattern is followed.
The radius of the area of effect, #[.s17]#and the damage are listed for each of the grenade&#8217;s #[.s18]#multiple explosions.
^&#8211;^Such grenades are dangerous to the expedition because they can easily hop their #[.s17]#way back to home ranks.
Unless properly identified, #

[.s11]#a multiple explosive grenade is indistinguishable #from a regular grenade.

[.s11]#Multiple explosive grenades are also known as jumping jacks.#

[table id=496 /] + &nbsp;

== 16) Napalm Grenade {.p136}

[table id=497 /]

[.s10]#The napalm grenade is unique in that it has a #[.s3]#swath area of effect as opposed to a spherical area #[.s10]#of effect.
When the grenade is discharged, it #[.s7]#launches itself into the air for an 8 hex trip while #[.s3]#raining adhesive flammables all along its course.
#[.s6]#Normally this grenade will launch itself in the #[.s8]#same direction that it was thrown.
If the thrower #[.s3]#is unskilled in grenade combat, and rolls less than #[.s9]#200 on her to hit roll the napalm grenade will #[.s8]#launch itself in a random direction.#

[.s7]#Anything caught in this blazing area of effect #[.s11]#will take the damage listed, will immolate, and will #[.s6]#continue burning for 2-8 units.
The continued #[.s7]#burning will inflict 2-24 hit points of damage each #unit.[.s3]#The 2 hex by 8 hex patch of flame will burn itself out in #[.s46]#+++<b>+++1 +++</b>+++#[.s3]#to 10 minutes.
Referees should also #[.s10]#be prepared to consider the effects of smoke #[.s7]#inhalation, which is unavoidable when this weapon #[.s3]#is used in enclosed spaces.#[.s60]#Napalm grenades are also labelled #[.s7]#phosphorous grenades and Smoky the Fear bombs.#

== 17) Pin Grenade {.p4}

[table id=498 /]

[.s8]#The pin grenade is the needier of area of effect combat.
The pin grenade pierces everything in its #[.s7]#4 hex radius of effect with hollow pins.
In addition #to the damage taken from the shower of pins, each [.s3]#projectile can inject toxins stored in its head.
This #[.s6]#means that organic targets will have to http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#saving-throw[make a]#[.s3]#http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#saving-throw[save vs.
poison], or be affected by the attack.#

[.s11]#Consult Table 45.4: Gas Type to determine #[.s3]#what kind of attack the pin grenade has.
A liquid #[.s8]#pharmaceutical could also be placed within the #[.s3]#holding well of the pin grenade.
There is a 20% #[.s7]#chance that a pin grenade will not harbor any toxin #at all, and this means it can be filled with whatever [.s8]#toxin the persona has available.#

[.s7]#The intensity of the chemical will vary from 3 #[.s3]#to 18.
The persona must make a saving throw even if a beneficial pharmaceutical has been placed in the pin grenade.
If the saving throw is successful #[.s6]#the drug will have no effect.
This#[.s8]# represents the randomness of dose that the target is receiving.#

The pin grenade is also known as a porcupine, [.s3]#or inoculator grenade.#

[table id=488 /]

== [.s7]#18) Pyrotechnic Grenade# {.p86}

[table id=499 /]

[.s7]#Pyrotechnic grenades are smoke, sonic, and flash weapons.
These are not used so much as weapons, #[.s8]#but as support devices for military maneuvers, or #[.s7]#a magic show.
Pyrotechnic grenades come in any #[.s8]#combination of the above, roll on Table 45.6 Pyro Combo#[.s43]#__ __to determine the pyrotechnics#.

[.s25]#[table id=500 /]#

[.s25]#*Smoke*: A# smoke grenade does nothing more [.s7]#than fill the area of effect with very dense smoke.
#[.s3]#The smoke will settle in 1 to 10 minutes.#

[.s65]#*Flash*:#[.s7]#Flash grenades will temporarily blind #[.s3]#any target that has optical sensors.
The sensors #[.s11]#(eyes, cameras) will remain inoperative for 1 to 10 #[.s7]#units.
There is a saving throw versus intensity 2 to #16 (2d8) poison.

[.s11]#*Sonic*: Sonic grenades have a lovely eardrum #[.s7]#numbing boom that accompanies their discharge.
#[.s3]#Any audio receptors in the area of effect will be #[.s11]#rendered completely inoperative for 1 to 10 minutes, #[.s8]#and ring- fer a good time after that.
There is a #saving throw versus intensity 2 to 16 (2d8) poison.

== 19) Radiation Grenade {.p39}

[table id=501 /]

[.s7]#The radiation grenade viciously douses its 12 hex #[.s8]#area of effect with a variety of lethal radiation #[.s3]#types.
Anyone caught in the bath area will take 3 to 18 HPS of damage, but must also save vs.
a #[.s11]#radiation attack of an intensity equal to the damage #[.s8]#rolled.
The attack will leave the area of effect #[.s3]#radioactive for 3-18 days, or 1 day per intensity #[.s7]#level of the radiation.
The radiation zone loses 1 #[.s9]#degree of intensity each day until clean.
The #[.s3]#radiation zone will always read anomalous to a #[.s8]#radiation detector.
#[.s6]#The radiation grenade is also known as a #[.s3]#Neutron grenade, or a micrograve.#

== 20) Skylighter Grenade {.p43}

[table id=502 /]

[.s18]#The sky lighter is a truly outdoorsy type of grenade.
#[.s7]#When it initially discharges, it inflicts no damage, #[.s8]#and explodes straight up, disappearing into the #[.s7]#sky.
2 to 6 units later all targets in the rectangular #[.s11]#area of effect will be rained upon with piercing ice.
#This grenade depends on complex meteorological [.s7]#mechanisms which are useless if used indoors, in #[.s3]#liquid free atmospheres, or in zero gravity.
#[.s3]#The sky lighter grenade is also known as a #[.s8]#painmaker, rainmaker, or chicken little bomb.#

== 21) Torc Grenade {.p159}

[table id=503 /]

[.s3]#The torc grenade does no damage to targets not #[.s18]#contained within a force field.
Any force field that comes into contact with the area of effect of a torc #[.s3]#grenade will be destroyed, and all occupants will #[.s7]#take the allotted damage (12-144 hit points).
#[.s8]#If the force field is less than 12 hexes in #[.s18]#radius, the torc grenade will destroy it, and damage #[.s3]#all targets with in it.
The torc grenade cannot #[.s18]#knock down a force field greater than 12 hexes in radius, but every target within it will take damage.
#[.s17]#The torc grenade will have no effect what so ever on #[.s18]#force fields greater than 24 hexes in radius.
A force field powered by a renewable power plant will stay #knocked down for 1 to 10 minutes.
[.s17]#The torc grenade is also known as a force field #disruptor.+++<figure id="attachment_2052" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2052" style="width: 202px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i0.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/aerosol.317-202x300.png?resize=202%2C300[Ding.

== {.p35}

== [.s23]#Aerosols# {.p35}

[.s7]#An aerosol is a cylindrical canister that violently #[.s3]#ejects a pressurized, gaseous solution through a #[.s11]#push button valve.
When activated, an aerosol will #[.s3]#discharge all of its contents, and cannot be used #again.
Unlike grenades, aerosols lack a history of [.s7]#military use.
The canisters could have arisen from #yet unforeseen methods of conflict, or could merely [.s10]#be maliciously employed industrial devices.
#[.s11]#Aerosols are rolled on the +++<i>+++Grenades /Aerosol Type +++</i>+++#[.s3]#table, and any roll greater than 50 will yield an #[.s7]#aerosol.
#

=== Range {.p41}

[.s28]#Aerosols:#[.s3]#The range of an aerosol depends #[.s10]#entirely on the pressure of its contents.
This #[.s7]#internal pressure usually ejects the contents ofthe #[.s3]#aerosol a safe distance before exploding with an area of effect blast.
Some aerosols have an swath #[.s11]#area of effect, and the range represents the longest dimension of this area of effect.
For more info see #[.s8]#chapter 30, Grenade and Aerosol Combat.#

=== Area of Effect {.p42}

 [.s30]#Aerosols:#[.s10]#An aerosol is an area of effect weapon.
First the contents of the aerosol are #[.s7]#sprayed a certain distance, and once reaching that #[.s11]#range (or hitting a solid object) the contents explode #[.s7]#about their area of effect.
For example, a freezing #[.s8]#aerosol has a 9 hex range, and an 8 hex area of #[.s6]#effect.
This aerosol fires out 9 hexes, and then #[.s8]#freezes everything in an 8 hex spherical area of #effect.

=== [.s1]#Damage# {.p44}

This is the hit point range that is inflicted upon any [.s7]#target caught within the area of effect of either an #[.s9]#aerosol or grenade.
Wherever the damage has #[.s7]#been omitted, the grenafielaerosol has some other #[.s8]#special effect.
Remember that damage is rolled #[.s3]#once, and applied to all targets within the area of #[.s7]#effect.
Unless specified therelis no save versus area of effect attacks.#

=== [.s1]#Wate# {.p45}

[.s7]#This is the wate of an unspent grenade, or aerosol.
#[.s3]#An empty aerosol canister has a wate 10% of its original wate.
E.g., 2 kg aerosol is reduced to an empty 200 gm canister.#

=== EXPS {.p44}

[.s8]#Experience points for identifying a grenade, or #[.s10]#aerosol, are earned the same as for any other #[.s3]#artifact.
An equivalent experience point value can #[.s7]#be earned after either weapon has been discharged, #[.s3]#but these EXPS#[.s31]#* *#[.s3]#can only be earned by the firer.
#

=== [.s1]#Value# {.p44}

[.s7]#The value of a grenade, or aerosol, is the value #of one charge.
In some cases aerosols can generate [.s5]#more than one charge, but even with these #[.s8]#modifications such aerosols still have the same #value.

=== Trigger {.p36}

[.s11]#Aerosols are even simpler to #[.s8]#use than grenades.
Push the release valve on top #[.s7]#of the canister, and all its contents instantly spray #[.s3]#out for all their described effects.#

=== [.s24]#Amount# {.p39}

[.s7]#The ref rolls a d8 to determine the number #[.s3]#of aerosol canisters found in a package.
#For powerful campaign altering aerosols one will suffice.

=== [.s25]#Description# {.p39}

The aerosol can appears [.s11]#to be an oversized version of today&#8217;s typical Freon #container.
The aerosol may have a distinctive colour--either the canister, or the jet--that can be [.s3]#rolled on the +++<i>+++Grenade Colour +++</i>+++table.#

[.s26]#Aerosol Markings:#[.s18]#Since many of the aerosols described in this chapter are non-military in.
nature, #[.s6]#many may still have their industrial labelling #[.s3]#intact.
To determine the literacy of an aerosol&#8217;s #[.s18]#labelling roll a d10.
A roll of 1 indicates unintelligible #[.s11]#labelling.
This is labelling that is either in an alien #[.s18]#language, has incorrect instructions, or is somehow #[.s3]#damaged.
A roll of 10 will yield an aerosol with #proper markings, and instructions.
Proper labelling [.s3]#may greatly reduce the ExPs value of an aerosol, #[.s7]#but increase its monetary value.
All other rolls (2#[.s3]#9) indicate that no markings of any sort are listed on the aerosol canister.#

== Aerosol Type {.p40}

Roll on table 45.6: Aerosol Type to determine aersosol type.
This table should not be used for generation of TOYs for personas.
It is not properly balanced for initial artifact rolls.

[table id=475 /]

== 22) Antilazer Aerosol {.p47}

[table id=504 /]

[.s18]#The antilazer aerosol will dissipate any lazer bolts which pass through its gaseous field.
The antilazer #aerosol cloud does not obscure vision, but it does [.s18]#does cause lazers to flare out into harmless glowing #[.s3]#balls.
The antilazer aerosol affects lazers, but #energy attacks--fission, fusion, plasma--are [.s3]#unaffected.
There is no limit to the amount of #[.s11]#damage that antilazer aerosol can dissipate, and #[.s8]#shimmering cloud will simply evaporate 1-10 #[.s7]#minutes after it was sprayed.#

== 23) Attraction Aerosol {.p6}

[table id=505 /]

[.s18]#The attraction aerosol is an incredibly potent anti-#repellant.
The attraction aerosol discharges [.s18]#pheromones, vibrations, chemicals, or sounds that #[.s7]#attract a particular type of creature.
Whatever #[.s3]#type of creature is affected by this aerosol will #[.s8]#swarm towards where it was discharged.
The #[.s7]#creatures will be hungry, desperately in love, or #[.s6]#just plain curious.
Exactly how many referee personas #[.s7]#approach the expedition depends mostly on the mood of the referee.
The ref should moderate a #[.s11]#wholesale onslaught of deadly attackers with lots of #[.s7]#harmless aliens.
The basic effect is: thrice as #[.s6]#many dangerous encounters a day;
this will #[.s3]#continue for 2 to 8 days.
#This aerosol is also known as a love bomb.

[table id=506 /]

== 24) Blinding Aerosol {.p162}

[table id=507 /]

[.s7]#Any target with organic optical sensors must save #[.s3]#versus poison or be blinded when subject to this attack.
Every 3 units spent within the cloud will #[.s6]#require the target to make another save versus #[.s3]#poison or be blinded.
The save is against intensity #[.s6]#2-20 (2d10) poison.
If blinded, the target will #[.s3]#remain blind for 0 to 9 minutes.
If the duration of the blindness is less than 1 minute, the target will #be blinded for 1 to 20 units.
The cloud of the aerosol is invisible, and will dissipate in 1 to 12 units.
Any [.s5]#target entering the cloud must save versus #blindness.
The blinding aerosol is commonly called tear gas.

== 25) Catabolic Dismodulator Aerosol {.p41}

[table id=508 /]

[.s3]#The catabolic dismodulator turns inorganic matter #[.s9]#into an opaque, multi-hued, cloud of gas.
The #[.s7]#effects are devastating to equipment, and robots.
If #[.s3]#the ref feels that the effects of this weapon may #severely disrupt the course of a campaign, she may [.s3]#allow persona robots a save versus intensity 13 to #[.s11]#28 (10+3d6) poison, or be destroyed.
Note that only #[.s6]#solid inorganic matter within the target hex is #[.s7]#dismodulated.
The 3 hex area of effect refers to the #[.s3]#cold damage taken by all targets within the area of effect cloud.
#Those organic creatures hit directly with a [.s5]#catabolic dismodulator have a 5% chance of  #[.s3]#dismodulating along with their equipment.
If the #[.s11]#dice should indicate this, it is only polite to offer the #[.s8]#same saving throw awarded to persona robots.
If #[.s3]#the player fails this roll her persona is dead.
Jump to http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#saving-throw[saving throws]  for more information.#

== 26) Demagnetizer Aerosol {.p6}

[table id=509 /]

[.s10]#The relevance of this aerosol to anything in #[.s3]#particular escapes me, it is sort of an industrial strength tape head cleaner which briefly nullifies the weak forces of magnetism.
#[.s3]#The obvious problems that could arise from this are: magnetic buckles detaching themselves;
#[.s11]#TV sets going blank;
magnetic legs (vehicles, and #[.s7]#robots) collapsing;
electronic components ceasing #to function;
computer memories being erased;
and [.s18]#little plastic animals falling off of the fridge.
Military #[.s3]#electronics will get a save versus mental attack, intensity 3 to 18, to avoid being affected by the #attack.
The magnet&#8217;s battery source, the magnets themselves, or any electronic components will be [.s6]#restored to normal operation after 3-18 units.
#[.s18]#There is a 1% chance per unit of dysfunction of a #[.s7]#device being permanently damaged.
See http://expgame.com/?page_id=286[Chapter 21: Equipment Damage] for what tragedy demagnetization could cause.
#

== 27) Disintegrator Aerosol {.p46}

[table id=510 /]

[.s4]#The disintegrator aerosol turns inorganic #[.s18]#substances into dust.
More refined, and discerning, than its cousin the http://expgame.com/?page_id=337#25-catabolic-dismodulator[catabolic dismodulator aerosol]#[.s11]#, the disintegrator aerosol will only affect a #[.s5]#certain substance.
The substance type is #[.s7]#determined on Table 45.8: Disintegration Type+++<i>+++.
+++</i>+++#Any amount of this material caught in the 1 hex [.s7]#area of effect will be broken down into a useless dust massing much less than its previous wate.#

[.s11]#Any complex equipment, composed of many #[.s7]#basic materials, caught in the area of effect has a #[.s5]#% chance, determined by the referee, of #[.s7]#malfunctioning.
The malfunction is assumed to #[.s3]#have been caused by some integral part of the #[.s18]#device disintegrating into dust.
The chance of #[.s8]#this happening can be determined by rolling #[.s18]#http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#sphincter-dice[Sphincter dice], as described in chapter 16, Special #[.s10]#Rolls.
The extent of the damage should be #[.s11]#determined in http://expgame.com/?page_id=286[Chapter 21: Equipment Damage]#

[table id=511 /]

== 28) Exploding Aerosol {.p4}

[table id=512 /]

[.s18]#This sadistic device explodes like a fragmentation #grenade when it is triggered.
All targets in the 1 [.s3]#hex area of effect take the damage listed.
The #[.s18]#referee should note that it is very impolite to laugh #when an exploding aerosol is discharged.

== *29) Foam Aerosol* {.p46}

[table id=513 /]

[.s17]#The foam aerosol creates a pad of creamy foam 16 #[.s8]#hexes across, and 2 hexes deep.
For the first #[.s11]#minute, the foam can be easily travelled through.
#[.s8]#By the end of the second minute the foam is #[.s17]#starting to thicken, and movement is halved.
Three minutes after being discharged the foam will be so #[.s3]#viscous that movement will be reduced to one #[.s11]#quarter.
The pad will be completely solidified 4 #[.s18]#minutes after its discharge, and anything caught #[.s11]#within it will be completely trapped.
At no time, #[.s18]#even during the solid phase, is breathing hampered #[.s17]#in any way by the foam.
Anything entombed by the #[.s18]#foam pad will starve to death before anything else.
#[.s17]#The foam is not much stronger than styrofoam, #[.s18]#but only those persons trapped in the outer edges, and those who are particularly industrious will be #able to free themselves.
[.s18]#The colour of the foam will be the same as on the outside of the aerosol canister.
Once solid, the #[.s7]#foam is structurally sound, and well insulated.
#This aerosol has been given synonyms such as the insulator, and the homemaker.

== 30) Freezing Aerosol {.p175}

[table id=514 /]

[.s3]#The freezing aerosol subjects all targets in its area of effect (8 hexes) to an enthalpy attack, coating #[.s7]#everything with ice and snow.
The freezing aerosol has a % chance, equal to the damage inflicted, of #[.s3]#entrapping large, or smaller, sized targets in ice.
This attack also freezes switches in place, triggers #[.s11]#in the firing position, pins in grenades, pant zippers #closed, etc.

== 31) Gas Aerosol {.p6}

[table id=515 /]

[.s11]#The gas aerosol fills the area of effect with a pall of #[.s3]#transparent, but noticeable gas.
The cloud of gas #[.s6]#will affect all within it, and saving throws vs.
#[.s7]#poison must be made for every unit within the area of effect.
The cloud will dissipate in 4 to 16 units.
The intensity of the poison in the gas cloud varies #[.s11]#between 2 and 16.
Roll on the below table to determine the effect of the gas.#

[.s1]#[table id=488 /]#

== 32) Invisibility Aerosol

[table id=516 /]

[.s18]#The magical invisibility aerosol permeates all visible #[.s3]#matter within its area of effect with a substance that does not reflect, or deflect the path of light.
#Everything in the area of effect will be undetectable [.s3]#to sensors that use reflected light.
Sonar, #[.s8]#infravision, ultravision, and other such sensors #[.s3]#will detect these &#8220;invisible&#8221;
objects normally.#

[.s3]#Everything within the hex of discharge will be #invisible: the ground, walls, equipment, personas, [.s3]#halves of personas.
The aerosol does an effective #[.s7]#job of making the targets disappear, but remember #[.s3]#that these invisible objects still exist.
Equipment is easily lost, personas still make noise, personas #[.s7]#still smell, and eye hand co-ordination is virtually #[.s3]#non-existent.
The invisibility aerosol can offer a #[.s6]#great escape route, but can also cause a lot of #[.s11]#trouble for the users.
The effects of this aerosol will #[.s7]#last for 1 to 4 days.#

== 33) Matter Detector Aerosol {.p184}

[table id=517 /]

[.s3]#The matter detector aerosol is much more useful than its title implies.
Any solid matter within the area of effect of this aerosol will be affixed with #[.s10]#chemicals that emit low levels of heat, light, #[.s7]#radiation, and vibrations.
This allows matter to be #[.s11]#detected by any of the more common sensors (eyes, #[.s3]#infravision, sonar, etc.).
The aerosol can also be used to determine whether something is composed #[.s9]#of solid matter or not.
Hence it makes a good #[.s3]#hologram detector also.#

[.s7]#All matter in the area of effect will glow light #[.s3]#blue, and then fade into glowing technicolor for 14 minutes.
The effect of the matter detector will continue for 1 to 4 minutes, and during that time any target can be seen through smoke, darkness, behind holograms, or in hiding places.
Any to hit #rolls will receive a bonus of +65 to hit on any target [.s5]#hit with a matter detector aerosol.
Hiding #[.s7]#maneuvers are 10 DDs more difficult if the persona #[.s8]#has been affected by this aerosol, and ambushes #[.s3]#are 10 times easier to detect.
Targets that wish to avoid detection may attempt to disappear after the #[.s8]#1-4 minute duration ends.
#[.s7]#This aerosol is also called a marker aerosol, or #[.s8]#a targeting aerosol.#

== 34) Mistor Aerosol {.p4}

[table id=518 /]

[.s7]#The mistor is the complete opposite to the matter detector aerosol.
The mistor renders all detection #equipment--eyes, sonar, infravision, touch, smell, [.s3]#everything--completely useless when within the #[.s3]#area of effect.
No lights can penetrate the cloud, yelling is futile, and everything feels cool to the #[.s6]#touch.
Virtually all sensors are dulled through #[.s7]#lack of stimuli.
Any attacks made are in a random direction, even if the target recently brushed against #[.s9]#the attacker.
Movement is random, unless the #[.s3]#persona has some form of heightened directional sense.
The suspension will remain cohesive for 1#6 days.

== 35) Molecular Diffusion Aerosol {.p10}

[table id=519 /]

[.s11]#The molecular diffusion aerosol is a nasty sounding #[.s7]#combat weapon that inflicts the prescribed damage #to all targets in the area of effect.
How the aerosol [.s3]#inflicts its damage, and what happens when it is discharged is left to the improvisational talents of the referee.#

== 36) Napalm Aerosol {.p188}

[table id=520 /]

[.s3]#The napalm aerosol blasts a swath of flaming gas #[.s8]#and gel when it is triggered.
This is definitely not a toy you&#8217;d like to mistakenly point backwards.
#[.s11]#Anything caught in the blazing area of effect will be #[.s7]#seared for 6 to 60 (6d10) hit points of damage, and #[.s10]#then promptly immolate for further damage.
Targets that have immolated will burn for an #[.s8]#additional 2 to 8 units.
Burning targets will take #an additional 4 to 24 hit points of damage each unit [.s10]#that they are aflame.
Other than the flaming #[.s3]#targets, the napalm aerosol will extinguish itself immediately.#

== 37) Paint Aerosol {.p190}

[table id=521 /]

[.s3]#The paint aerosol can be used to paint the entire wall of a room with one explosive button push.
#[.s7]#Unfortunately this time saving feature will paint #[.s18]#everything in front of the wall also.
The completely #[.s7]#indiscriminate nature of the paint aerosol allows it #[.s10]#to be used as a weapon.
When sprayed onto #[.s7]#opponents, or expedition members, they must make #[.s8]#a successful saving throw versus poison, or be #[.s11]#blinded for 1 to 20 units.
The intensity of the poison #[.s3]#will be from 1 to 12.
The referee may allow the #[.s11]#player to use her persona&#8217;s DEX instead of CON for #[.s8]#this saving throw.
The paint colour will be the #[.s3]#same as the colour of the aerosol canister.#

[table id=443 /]

== 38) Pharmaceutical Aerosol {.p6}

[table id=522 /]

[.s9]#This aerosol can be used to apply long range #[.s3]#prescriptions to groups of patients.
What sort of #[.s43]#plague, military infestation, or Woodstock #[.s9]#celebration prompted the invention of such a #[.s3]#dispenser is unknown.
The pharmaceutical type, #[.s7]#effect, duration, etc.
is determined in http://expgame.com/?page_id=347[Chapter 50: ]#[.s6]#http://expgame.com/?page_id=347[Pharmaceuticals].#

[.s18]#All targets in the area of effect must fail a save #versus poison to be affected by the medication.
The intensity of the poison (pharmaceutical) is 2 to 20.
[.s7]#This intensity is reduced by one for every target in #[.s3]#the area of effect.
The more potential users, the #[.s11]#milder the dose.
Note that it is possible to make the #[.s3]#spray from this aerosol completely ineffective by #[.s7]#having too many targets in the area of effect.
The #[.s6]#cloud dissipates immediately after it has been #ejected.

== 39) Poison Aerosol {.p4}

[.s11]#[table id=523 /]#

[.s11]#The poison aerosol is a very selective, very lethal, #[.s7]#combined nerve gas and respiratory poison.
Whatever #type of creature is poisoned _ _[.s3]#by this aerosol must make a save versus intensity 2 to 24 poison, or die.
Creatures that save versus #[.s7]#the poison attack will automatically be repulsed by #[.s3]#the 12 hex x 3 hex swath, and will not cross, or #[.s7]#approach the lingering residue.
The attack is only #[.s8]#lethal to those targets caught within the initial #blast, but the repellant effect will linger for 1 to 3 hours.
[.s6]#These population strength poison aerosols #[.s3]#are usually labelled &#8220;raid&#8221;, or nerve gas canisters.#

[table id=488 /]

== [.s19]#40) Repellent Aerosol# {.p103}

[table id=524 /]

[.s11]#This is the pacifist&#8217;s version of the poison aerosol#[.s7]#.
Creatures of the repelled type must save #[.s11]#versus poison (intensity 13-28), or not be able to #approach anything covered by this aerosol.
The [.s11]#aerosol will start to repulse creatures at a 10 hex #[.s18]#range.
This repelling effect will last for 1 to 6 days.
Intelligent creatures may make an additional save each new day in which they approach the repulsive #area.
Unintelligent aliens will most likely bolt in [.s7]#terror when failing to save versus the repellent.
#[.s8]#This aerosol is also called off, repex, or #protector.

[table id=1056 /]

== 41) Siren Aerosol {.p78}

[table id=525 /]

[.s11]#This ear splitting siren will wail for 2-8 minutes, #[.s18]#inflicting 2-12 hit points of damage to all within the area of effect.
The siren aerosol will inflict double #damage to mutants employing sonar.
There is also [.s11]#a 10% chance per hit point of damage inflicted of #[.s18]#that the target will become deaf.
There is no saving throw granted.
Hearing will be restored after 1-10 #[.s7]#hours.
The screeching will continue to inflict 2 to #[.s3]#12 hit points of damage each minute until the #[.s11]#hearing target is deafened, unconscious or out of #range.
[.s18]#This aerosol has severe environmental effects.
When used outdoors most of the smaller animals--#[.s9]#birds, hares, jackalopes, and rats--in the 1 #[.s6]#kilometer radius of effect will be killed.
The #[.s17]#expedition will also have to deal with a considerable #[.s18]#number of deaf, confused, and possibly angry local #fauna.

== 42) Smoke Aerosol {.p188}

[table id=526 /]

[.s7]#This smoke aerosol will instantly discharge a 24 hex diameter sphere of dense smoke.
The smoke #[.s18]#will obscure the vision of any visual sensors caught #[.s11]#within its field.
This means that there is a -230 per #hex to hit penalty for ranged attacks, unless the [.s17]#persona has some sort of smoke cutting device.
The #smoke is so dense that it can only be moved by a [.s7]#gale force wind, or a bulldozer.
The cloud will #disperse in 1 to 8 weeks.
The colour of the smoke [.s7]#will be the same as the colour of the canister that #it was ejected from.

== 43) Web Aerosol {.p203}

[table id=527 /]

[.s7]#The web aerosol splatters the area of effect with a #[.s11]#super adhesive goo.
Anything caught in the area of #[.s10]#effect will be trapped until the webby mess #[.s3]#dissipates 2-16 minutes later.
Any persona that #[.s11]#saunters into the messy web will instantly become #[.s18]#glued.#

[.s3]#To escape the persona must make a bizarre #[.s11]#PSTR roll (kilo-die).
Otherwise she is trapped until #[.s6]#the web decomposes.
During each escape attempt the #[.s7]#entrapped persona must ensure that she does not glue #[.s3]#her mouth and nose shut risking suffocation.
There #[.s18]#is a 1% chance of this happening each time that she #[.s3]#struggles (attempts to break free).
The colour of #[.s18]#the web will be the same as the colour of the aerosol #[.s7]#canister.#[.s9]#The persona can attempt to make subtle #[.s11]#movements, such as pulling a gun trigger, activating #[.s3]#an aerosol, or taking a pharmaceutical.
To this #[.s11]#properly she must make a successful difficult DEX #[.s7]#(d20) roll, or be unable to move at all.#

[.s3]#Procedures such as burning, dissolving or disintegrating the web will have varying chances #[.s11]#of success.
The chance of an action being successful #[.s3]#can be determined by rolling Sphincter dice, as #[.s11]#described in chapter 16, Special Rolls.
Each attempt #[.s3]#to free a persona will indicate a chance to entrap #[.s7]#the rescuer.
#A web aerosol is also known as silly string.
