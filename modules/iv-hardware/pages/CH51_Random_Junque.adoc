[.s3]#The title of this chapter is completely self #[.s4]#explanatory.
The tables contained in here are #[.s5]#filled with lists of completely useless equipment.
It #[.s6]#is almost certain that these artifacts have existed #[.s7]#in every society in one form or another.
#[.s7]#Random junque is useless equipment, but if #[.s8]#the persona can somehow make use of it during the #[.s7]#campaign, then that is fantastic.
There should be #[.s5]#copious EXPS awards for players that turn nothing #[.s6]#into something.
Random junque is not entirely worthless, it has a random value of 1 to 10 eps, and #each piece of random junque has a 10% chance of [.s6]#having a spare part useful to a mechanic.#

[.s5]#To generate random junque the player makes one roll on Table 51.0, +++<i>+++Random Junque, +++</i>+++and then #refers to the designated table type.
Random junque [.s5]#does not count as a roll for players generating start #up Toys.+++<figure id="attachment_5349" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5349" style="width: 213px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i2.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/random_Junque_Bin-213x300.png?resize=213%2C300[One anthro's garbage is another anthro's junk.,213]](https://i1.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/random_Junque_Bin.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5349" class="wp-caption-text">+++One anthro&#8217;s garbage is another anthro&#8217;s junk.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== 16) Ref&#8217;s Own Table {.p102}

[.s9]#The ref&#8217;s own table for random junque should #[.s10]#consist of those useless things that are found in the #[.s5]#culture that she is creating.
It may be a bit cynical, but this system is created with the belief that their #[.s10]#will always be waste, incompetence and corruption #[.s9]#available to waste corporate, and government #[.s5]#dollars on useless items.
Another thing to consider #[.s8]#is whether or not it is worth having a refs own table #[.s6]#for random junque.
There are lots of things to #[.s8]#prepare for the referee already, and unless random #[.s7]#junque is really offering something humorous to the milieu then may she should go do something #else.
