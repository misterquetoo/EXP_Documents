= Robot Shape
Most robots have a mechanical shape. 
Unless the robot has some skill that disguises itself robots appear like robots.
The robot shape has no bearing on attacks, peripherals or defences.
The player can choose what she likes: fire hydrant, filing cabinet, kitchen appliance, etc.
If some random assistance is needed consult the below tables.
The tables only offer a shape. 
The colour, design, sound, decals, smell, or detailing is up to the player.
The referee may have some commercial patching depending on the campaign.

== Basic Shape
The volume of the robot will fit into this shape.
Feel free to contort the shape.

== Contortion of Basic Shape
This table manipulates the basic shape so that the infinity that is commercial design is reflected.
