= Mental Mutations
Mental mutations function through the thinkspace of the EXP mythos.
These mutations may impact the physical space, but the effect is delivered through the thinkspace.
The thinkspace is a faux concept where organic consciousnesses exist. 
In this space, consciousnesses interact, allowing for extrasensory perception and mind control.
Mental mutations do not alter the persona's appearance, making these mutants indistinguishable from other personas.
These mutations are also called psionics, psychic powers, or mental attacks. 

Mental mutations require concentration of the mind, like lifting a weight involves contraction of the muscles.
The attribute that powers mental mutations is mental strength.

== Mental Mutation Type

include::ROOT:partial$CH58_Table_Mental_Mutation_Type.adoc[]

== Mutation Types 

=== Absorption

[horizontal]
Range:: Persona
Duration:: Until Dead
Frequency:: Constant
General Bonus:: Combat Ratio +4

This mutant can absorb the assigned force that would typically damage her.
A laser bolt will dissipate over her entire body, or radiation will pass through her unaffected.
The damage type that the persona can absorb is determined on the Absorption Table.
A persona with absorption can absorb an amount of damage equal to her HPS Maximum plus 3 HPS per experience level.
Damage cannot be reduced to less than one point of damage.
For example, a level 4 persona with 30 HPS could absorb 42 HPS in damage.
If the attack is supposed to inflict less than 42 HPS of damage, she will take no damage.
Absorption cannot be used to gain HPS.

For combined attacks the players may need consult the xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH16_Special_Rolls_Asshole.adoc[Sphincter Dice,window=_blank].

include::ROOT:partial$CH58_Table_Absorption_Type.adoc[]

=== Alternate Banishment

[horizontal]
Range:: 1h per Level
Duration:: Permanent
Frequency:: Daily per 12 Adjusted MSTR
General Bonus:: Combat Ratio +10

This mutation allows the mutant to transport objects to an alternate space of existence.
An object can include whole personas, and they are transported against their will.
This mutation can only be employed in situations of extreme duress;
like combat, surprise, or imminent death, etc.
The mutant can only banish complete objects.
If the object exceeds the mutant's power, then she cannot banish it.
The mutant can banish half her wate plus 5 kg per level.
A corpulent 4th level persona with a wate of 80 kg could banish any object less than 60kg.

All targets get a save vs psionic attack.
If the save is successful, the mutation has no effect.
Inorganic objects have a MSTR equal to the persona holding it.
Stray objects have a MSTR of 0-9 (1d10-1).

No one knows where the alternate space is, and the object or persona is permanently removed from the campaign. 
Isn't that like being killed?
Yes, it is precisely like being killed.

=== Animal Attachment 

[horizontal]
Range:: Touch
Duration:: Permanent
Frequency:: 1 Animal per 7 Levels
General Bonus:: +10 on biologist rolls

Animal attachment is pet bonding to the highest degree.
The persona and an animal become psionically attached.
The connection is totally different than a human-pet relationship.
There is a synergistic effect that elevates the animal to a much higher level of function.
The animal must be an alien that is defined as cannon fodder, or flora, or fauna. 
The alien must be smaller than the persona. 
The persona's wate must be twice that of the alien.
The persona must be smarter than the alien. 
The persona's intelligence must be 3 times that of the alien.
For example, a persona has a wate of 60kg and intelligence of 12.
This persona could bond with an alien 30kg or less and an INT of 4 or less.

The persona initiates the animal attachment.
The animal must win a psionic roll to avoid attachment.
If the bonding fails, the animal wanders off and can never be convinced again.
Successful bonding creates a telepathic bridge, sharing knowledge, intelligence and communication.

The animal immediately increases its intelligence through the connected consciousnesses.
The persona's intelligence score is added to the animal's intelligence.
In the example above, the persona would have a 12 INT, and the alien could have a new INT as high as 16.
This makes the attached animal more intelligent than the persona.
The animal frequently reminds the persona of this fact. 
Whether the alien's MSTR is increased or not is up to the players. 

The alien heightens her previous drives of food and reproduction.
She can guide the persona to clean water, clean food and eligible partners.
The last heightened ability often has the alien always making said suggestions. 
This is supposed to be a comedic relief source as the alien's timing is never that good. 

The two can speak telepathically without anyone noticing the connection. 
They just appear to be happier than the usual anthro-pet combo. 
The alien can only speak beyond telepathically with the persona.
The alien does not use a name with communicating telepathically.
The connection between the two is beyond names. 

The bond is inseparable. 
The death of the persona will result in the death of the alien.
The death of the alien will severely impact the persona.
If the persona could have prevented the death, she will be hit with severe attribute injuries. 
The sudden loss of counsel and telepathic connection crushes the persona's INT and MSTR.
The persona loses 1-6 (1d6) points on each attribute.
If either attribute drops below zero, the persona is dead.
The lowered attributes will return at 1 point per day. 
The player can add the point to either attribute until she heals.
The persona can only get another animal attachment once her attributes have been restored.

An unwritten permutation of this mutation is analog attachment. 
This allows the persona to have the same relationship with a robot.
Both intelligence and wate requirements apply. 

=== Calculations 

[horizontal]
Range:: Persona Only
Duration:: Until Dead
Frequency:: As Needed
General Bonus::  +15 on any calculation rolls

Calculations allows the mutant to solve any mathematical analysis in seconds.
This arithmetic savant does not need paper, calculator to get the answer.
The mutant does require accurate data to work with. 
It is not a case of garbage in garbage out; the persona knows what info is missing.
When it comes to arithmetic, this mutant is fast as any artificial intelligence.
The answer will be blurted out within 2 seconds. 

This will make the mutant an excellent gambler, estimator, or astrogator.
The mutation is revered by mechanics and nothings. 
Any persona with this mutation can replace a space vehicle's astrogation software.

=== Communicate 

[horizontal]
Range:: Earshot
Duration:: Special
Frequency:: Special
General Bonus:: +15 on any language rolls

This mutant's brain understands the subliminal semiotics (meaning) of language.
Communicate allows her to communicate with any communicating entity.
The method of communication must be detectable by the persona.
As long as there are sounds, smells, motions, vibrations, she will understand.
Understanding the language does not always lead to communication.
For example, the aliens communicate using chemicals that the mutant cannot recreate.
So she will understand but not be able to 'smell' back.

If the mutant wants to speak the language permanently, she has a chance to add it to her repertoire.
There is a chance equal to the persona's adjusted intelligence times three of adding the language.
A 4th level mutant with a 10 INT would have a 42% chance to memorize the language.
If the language is essential to the persona she can try again later. 
Later is determined by the referee.
The mutant can have a number of languages equal to her level plus INT memorized.
The mutant described above could memorize 14 languages.

A memorized language allows a mutant to pass any fluency test, avoid idiomatic errors in diplomacy, and develop devices to help her communicate.
This mutation is especially helpful for biologists and nothings. 

=== Cryokinesis 

[horizontal]
Range:: 1h per Adjusted MSTR
Duration:: 5u per Adjusted MSTR
Frequency:: Once per 5 Adjusted MSTR
General Bonus:: Combat Ratio +3

Cryokinesis allows the mutant to make things around her very cold.
This mutation may be employed in a nasty way or a benevolent way.

The nasty cryokinesis is a mental attack.
The cryokinesis attack freezes the target's consciousness with a deadly chill.
The mental attack starts with a chill and eventually creates a corpscicle.
The target automatically takes 1-4 (1d4) hit points of damage in the first unit.
After the first unit, the target can repel the attack by winning a psionic roll.
The amount of damage inflicted increases by 1-4 (1d4) each unit the mutant attacks.

For example, the target takes 1d4 damage in the first unit.
If the target fails her next three psionic rolls, she will take more damage each combat unit.
Failing 3 rolls would result in 2d4 in the second unit, 3d4 in the third unit, and 4d4 in the fourth unit.
The target will either break the freeze attack or die.
When a target is killed by this attack, it is frozen solid.
If the freeze cycle restarts, the damage per unit restarts at 1d4. 
A mutant with a 10 MSTR could inflict up to 50d4 in damage in her last unit.

The benevolent cryokinesis acts like a psychic air conditioner.
This cooling only works on organic consciousnesses and cannot cool a machine or robot.
The mutant can comfortably cool organics in a four hex radius.


=== Death Field Generation 

[horizontal]
Range:: 1h per Level
Duration:: Permanent
Frequency:: Special
General Bonus:: Combat Ratio *3

This deadly mutation allows the mutant to drain life from surrounding organic personas.
Death field generation instantly drains hit points from the target(s) caught in the area of effect.
If a target persona fails her psionic roll all of her hit points are drained.
Anthros Hit Points Total is reduced to negative one half her Hit Points Maximum.
Aliens Hit Points Total is reduced to zero.
Robots are not affected by this mental attack.
Jump to xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH13_Health.adoc#_death[Death,window=_blank] for more info about persona death.

The process is instantaneous and the mutant collapses unconscious afterwards.
The mutant remains unconscious for l minute per hit point consumed.
If the mutant absorb 90 hit points from target personas she would remain unconscious for an hour and a half.
During this unconscious state the mutant is very vulnerable.
Once the mutant regains consciousness, she may immediately use her death field generation again.

The mutant cannot control the range of the death field generation. 
Initially it sucks the life out of everything within 1 hex range.
At second level it absorbs all life within 2 hexes, and so on.
The mutant becomes more and more dangerous as her experience level increases.

The mutant can deselect 1 consciousness per 3 levels of experience. 
At 6th level the mutant's death field has an enormous 6 hex area of effect and she can spare two personas from death.

The referee can modify the duration of unconsciousness to limit the power of this mutation.
For example, the mutant may be unconscious for 1 hour per hit point. 

=== Density Control 

[horizontal]
Range:: 10h plus 1h per Level
Duration:: 3u per Adjusted MSTR
Frequency:: 1 per 4 Adjusted MSTR
General Bonus:: Combat Ratio +3

If the target wins the psionic roll, they are unaffected by the mutation.
This mutation can be used on organic and inorganic targets.
If the target is an object with no attributes, it is assigned a random MSTR of 0-9 (1d10-1).
If a target repels the density control, the mutant may try the next unit again.

The target must have a wate less than 10 times the mutant's wate.

Increasing density makes the target's molecular structure tighter and increases its wate in the same volume.
Armour rating increases by 20%.
Movement rate is decreased by 20%.
Any force related damage is decreased by 20%.
Falling damage is doubled.
Inanimate objects double their wate. 
Flying creatures fall from the sky.
Swimming creatures sink.

Decreasing density loosens the target's molecular structure and decreases its wate in the same volume.
Armour rating decreases by 20%.
Movement rate is increased by 20%, but the target has an increased chance of falling.
Any force related damage is increased by 20%.
Falling damage is decreased by 60%
Inanimate objects halve their wate. 
Flying creatures don't fall from the sky but can't fly in a straight line.
Swimming creatures float uncontrollably towards the surface.


=== Detections 

[horizontal]
Range:: 10h per Adjusted AWE
Duration:: Special
Frequency:: As Needed
General Bonus:: +20 on searching rolls

Detections give the mutant a veritable suite of organic detectors.
The persona gets one detection skill per 5 points of awareness.
If the persona has a 15 AWE, she will get three rolls on the below table.
For example, she could detect water, poison and food.
If the same detection is rolled twice, the detection mutation is twice as effective.
A doubled detection has twice the range and doubles the effectiveness. 

This mutation has two functional elements: detecting and locating.

Detecting happens immediately. 
If a lie, life or a robot is present, this mutation will immediately detect it.
These detections have a binary presentation. 
Yes, there is a lie, but not what the lie is.
Yes, the is life, but not whether it is friend or foe.

When used to locate resources, the resource must actually be present. 
For example, looking for pharma will only work if there is pharma to find. 
This is up to the referee.
The chance of successfully sniffing out a resource is equal to three times the persona's awareness.
For example, a persona with 14 AWE has a 42% chance of finding safe water.
The water must be within range, and the search will last about 1-12 (1d12) minutes. 
This mutation will also send personas in the correct general direction of the water. 

include::ROOT:partial$CH58_Table_Detection_Type.adoc[]

=== Directional Sense 

[horizontal]
Range:: Special
Duration:: Constant
Frequency:: As Needed
General Bonus:: +30 on wayfinding rolls

This mutant psionically locates herself within the thinkspace and cannot get lost.
Directional sense allows the mutant to take a correct heading from as little as a claw's pointing.
The mutation has an unlimited range, but it does not work through hyperspace.
If the mutant remains on the planet, she cannot get lost.
She will find her way 'back' after air travel, underwater travel or unconscious travel.
Knowing where to go does not guarantee the ability to get there.
Travel may require boats, planes, or even space vehicles. 
Directional sense does not work through hyperspace, and the mutant cannot find her way home after a special drive jump. 

This mutant is an absolute master of all navigation. 
This includes astrogation, aquatic, subaquatic and terrestrial navigation.


=== Empathy 

[horizontal]
Range:: 1h per Adjusted MSTR
Duration:: Special
Frequency:: 1 per 4 Adjusted MSTR
General Bonus:: +20 for interpersonal rolls

This mutation allows the mutant to experience the feelings of personas near her.
Empathy picks up on emotions like fear, joy, sorrow, pain, etc.
Most personas will not notice that the mutant is "listening in" on their emotions. 
If the mutant is lightly probing a target for superficial emotions, the target will not notice the intrusion.

When the mutant starts to dig deeper into the target's consciousness, a psionic roll is given.
If the target wins the roll, they will notice the intrusion.
A second psionic roll must be won to block the mutant from reading her emotions.

The information gained from empathic probing has many advantages for the mutant.
It will assist them greatly in negotiation, gambling, leadership, and dating.
Empathy is not mind reading and does not give off details of plans or goals. 

=== Energy Attraction 

[horizontal]
Range:: 10h per MSTR
Duration:: Until Dead
Frequency:: Constant
General Bonus:: Defect

This mental mutation defect turns the persona into an energy sink.
When an energy weapon is fired near this mutant, the bolt may redirect towards her.
If a lazer, fission gun, plasma gun is fired within the range of this defect, there is a chance it will change direction towards her.
This includes the energy attacks of fellow personas.
The chance is equal to the persona's MSTR.
If the mutant has a 10 MSTR, there is a 10% chance an energy weapon will change direction towards her.
An attack roll that was directed at another persona is redirected at this mutant.
Ouch.

The redirected attack wastes significant energy and accuracy when changing direction.
The attack roll has a penalty of -200. 
If the attack roll is a hit, the damage is reduced by 25%.
If the attack roll is a miss, the energy beam dissipates harmlessly.

Energy attraction only affects gun attacks and does *not* attract artillery, bombs, or grenades.
The fusion gun is specifically not attracted by this mutation. 

Energy attraction turns off if the mutant is unconscious or sleeping.
Directly attacking this mutant with an energy weapon does not improve the attack roll. 

include::ROOT:partial$Defect_Disclaimer.adoc[]

=== Extrasensory Perception 

[horizontal]
Range:: 2h per Adjusted MSTR
Duration:: 2u per Adjusted MSTR
Frequency:: Special
General Bonus:: Combat Ratio +5, +20 on interpersonal rolls

Extrasensory perception (ESP) allows the mutant to listen in on the thoughts of other personas.
This is the most famous of all the psionic powers in the world of sciency fiction.
The mutant can probe the consciousness of organic creatures through the thinkspace.
The persona does not listen in on actual words, but the icons of sentience. 
This allows the understanding of any type of organic mind regardless of language or family.
ESP is not able to probe a robotic mind. 

The players are not expected to interpret the semiotics of alien consciousness.
The referee will simply reveal the thoughts in plain language.
For example, the mutant would know if a target brain is planning an attack.
The mutant could also learn what cards a gambler is holding.
A lie would not only be detected, but the nature of the lie and what truth is as well.
Having an Esper (a mutant with ESP) mutant is a total game-changer for the referee.

A consciousness will attempt to repulse this level of intrusion.
Before any information can be gleaned, the target must lose a psionic roll. 
A win on the psionic roll blocks the mutant from reading the target mind.
A win on the psionic roll does not allow the persona to alter her thoughts to trick the mutant.
Only another Esper could send fake thoughts to the mutant. 
It is also impossible for the persona to know who or what was invading her mind.

A failure on the psionic roll gives the mutant free range inside the target's mind.
The mutant has limited time inside the target mind. 
The mutant can read the target mind for 1 unit per point of adjusted MSTR.
For example, a mutant with an adjusted MSTR of 15 could browse the target mind for half a minute.
At the end of this time, the target gets another psionic roll to block the intrusion.
The mutant may "listen in" until a psionic roll throws her out.

Once blocked from reading the target mind, the mutant must have one night of restful sleep before trying again.
The mutant can only listen to once consciousness at a time. 

For the referee, this mutation can be a challenge. 
It is easy to inform the player what is going on in the minds of referee personas. 
The referee can reveal plans, desires and ridiculous misconceptions about food to the player.
The challenge is when the player decides to probe the mind of fellow players.
This would be the highest level of team role-playing.
The referee may just ask a player what their persona is thinking.
The mutant may or may not have nefarious intent with the information. 
This kind of power is what leads to a general mistrust of mental mutation powers.

=== Force Field Generation 

Range:: Persona Only
Duration:: Until Destroyed
Frequency:: 1 per Sleep
General Bonus:: Combat Ratio *2

The force field generation mutation creates a protective shell around the mutant.
The force field may appear as a shimmering translucent shell or be completely transparent.
The shell will keep out rain, dirt, bugs, small animals, and other harmless nuisances.
The force field will also absorb bullets, lazer bolts, clubs, fire, aerosols, explosions, etc.
The force field does not prevent gases from gently wafting into the psionic protective shell.

The mutant is always at the center of the force field, and it moves around with her.
The mutant can't generate her force field and leave it behind.
The mutant cannot create multiple force fields or partial force fields.
The force field continues to function if the mutant is unconscious.
The force field persists until the mutant turns it off, or it is destroyed.

The force field is damaged by anything that would injure the mutant.
The force field can withstand 10 hit points per point of adjusted MSTR.
A 4th level persona with a 16 MSTR has a force field that can withstand 200 hit points of damage.
For example, an attacker scores a successful attack roll and rolls 17 hit points of damage.
This damage is subtracted from the mutant's force field and not the mutant.
An attack roll must be successful before the force field is damaged.

The force field will not prevent attacks from poison gas or radiation.
These attacks can still waft into the shell.
The intensity of attack is reduced by half as it passes through the force field.
Most psionic attacks are unaffected by the force field.
Extrasensory perception is unaffected, while mental blast is completely absorbed.
If the mental attack acts via the physical space, it will be absorbed by the force field.
The force field does not work exatmo and cannot protect the mutant from the vacuum of space.

The shell allows anything to exit (except the mutant).
The mutant can attack from within her force field using ranged attacks. 
The mutant cannot use type A attacks (non-powered thrusting and striking weapons) from within the shell.
Unwanted objects within the force field can easily be evicted by the mutant.
To share the force field with other personas, they must be hugging the mutant before shell generation. 
If they let go, they will be ejected from the force field. 

The mutant requires one night of restful sleep to generate another force field. 

=== Gyrokinesis 

[horizontal]
Range:: 1h per Adjusted MSTR
Duration:: 1u per Adjusted MSTR
Frequency:: 1 per 6 Adjusted MSTR
General Bonus:: Combat Ratio +3

This mutation forces a target to involuntarily revolve.
The target will slightly elevate from the ground and begin to spin.
The spin is around the target's longitudinal axis and parallel with gravity.
Gyrokinesis does not allow for translational motion, and the target spins the same spot.
Angular momentum is thrown to the wind, and the target cannot alter her rotation frequency.

The first unit of this mental attack automatically affects the target.
The target is held in place and involuntarily begins to spin.
The initial frequency of the revolutions is not high.
The target suffers -50 on her attack roll, and +50 on attack rolls against her.
The spinning makes it harder for her to hit a target and easier to be hit.
In the second unit of the attack, the target gets a psionic roll. 
If she wins the psionic roll, the spinning stops.
If she fails the psionic roll, she spins even faster, and the penalties get even worse.
The target's attack roll suffers a -100 penalty, and attacks against her increase to +100.
The target must win a CON attribute roll or fall unconscious.
This process repeats each unit until the target goes unconscious.
In the 3rd unit of the attack, the target suffers a -150 attack roll penalty, a +150 bonus against her. She must win a CON attribute roll at -1 or go unconscious. 

.*Example Gyrokinesis Attack*
. No psionic roll allowed. -50 attack roll. +50 to be attacked.
. -100 attack roll. +100 to be attacked. CON attribute roll to stay conscious.
. -150 attack roll. +150 to be attacked. CON attribute roll -1 to stay conscious.
. -200 attack roll. +200 to be attacked. CON attribute roll -2 to stay conscious.
. -250 attack roll. +250 to be attacked. CON attribute roll -3 to stay conscious.
. A steady-state is reached. The CON attribute roll penalty increases. 

The target can only use abilities like mental mutations while spinning.
It is impossible to do complicated maneuvers or tasks. 

If helpful personas grapple the mutant, they may begin to spin as well. Touching the mutant adds the rescuers to the spinning mess if they fail a psionic roll.

After the first unit, the target will be spinning too fast to be grabbed.
Fastening the target down prevents spinning but does not prevent the attack's effects.

The gyrokinesis attack stops if the target wins a psionic attack roll.
The target will be incapacitated for 1 minute per unit she was spinning. 
The gyrokinesis attack stops if the target loses consciousness. 
The target will remain unconscious for 5 minutes per unit she was spinning.
The gyrokinesis attack stops if the target dies. 
The target will remain dead permanently.

Gyrokinesis can be used against organic and inorganic targets. 
Inanimate objects have a MSTR of 0-9 (1d10-1) and will resist being spun about.

=== Heightened Brain Talent 

[horizontal]
Range:: Persona Only
Duration:: Special
Frequency:: Once per Sleep  
General Bonus:: Special

Heightened brain talent allows the mutant to the whole brain to obsess over one specific problem.
The mutant curls up into a ball, her temperature rises, and her eyes flicker and blink.
The fit of cerebral activity is easily mistaken for a seizure.
The problem-solving trance lasts 1-4 (1d4) minutes.

The fruit of this ungraceful spasm of thinking is an answer.
The answer will almost always be correct, but the solution will usually be complicated.
The percent chance of coming up with a correct answer is 90 plus the mutant's INT score.
This percent chance of success cannot exceed 99%.
A mutant with and 15 INT would have a 99% chance of success, not a 105% chance of success.
If the answer is wrong, the mutant will know and will dispense with the answer immediately.

This mutation is extremely powerful and limited at the same time.
Heightened brain talent should not short circuit session puzzles or a campaign arch.
The player can be given a truthful and correct answer to the question.
However, the solution to this answer could be very complicated.
The answer can be known, but the solution may require sneaking into a restricted area.
Heightened brain talent should advance the story, not short circuit the story.

Heightened brain talent does not allow the mutant to predict the future or solve the mysteries of consciousness.
The following questions are unsolvable. Will I die if I do this? Why are we here? Or what is the "question to the answer"?
Unsolvable questions will injure the mutant and leave her bemusedly confused for 2-16 (2d8) days.

=== Hostility Field 

[horizontal]
Range:: 1h Radius
Duration:: Until Dead
Frequency:: Constant
General Bonus:: -25 on negotiation rolls

This mutation has a self-explanatory title.
There is a field of hostility that surrounds this mutant.
The mutant has some strange psychic effect on all creatures within a one hex range, causing them to have hostile emotions towards the mutant.
This defect has no effect or inorganic personas. 

Outside of the radius of effect, personas have an indifferent attitude towards the mutant.
This indifference turns to overt hostility once inside the area of effect.
During moments of disagreement, the hostility can become quite acute.
Between expedition members, this will rarely come to blows.
If a fight does break out between expedition members, it will always be xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH37_Non_Lethal_Combat.adoc[Non-Lethal Combat,window=_blank].
However, flora, fauna, pets, and personas of extremely low INT will attack the mutant.

Mutations with this defect suffer many challenges within the campaign.
Veterinarians are repulsed by them when trying to heal them.
Or patients are repulsed by a veterinarian with this mutation.
Relationships do not work out, ever.
Store clerks are more than rude.
Negotiations go poorly. 
Family dinners were cancelled long ago.
Mutants with this defect are often isolated and surrounded by inorganic personas.

=== Illusion Generation 

[horizontal]
Range:: 5h per Adjusted MSTR
Duration:: Special
Frequency:: 1 per 4 Adjusted MSTR
General Bonus:: Combat Ratio +5

Illusion generation allows the mutant to generate sounds, images and sensations for the target.
These illusions can range from a faint noise to a full audiovisual experience.
The illusion only appears in the sensorium of the target. 
If the target wins a psionic roll, the illusion will not form.

An auditory illusion could distract a target and have her wander off to investigate.
An olfactory illusion could divert hungry flora or fauna. 
A visual illusion could cause a driver to veer off the road.
A complete illusion with sound, smell, sensation, and moving imagery could trick a persona into engaging in a battle no one else can see. 

The mutation illusion generation only works on organic personas.

The target will completely believe the illusion if they fail their psionic roll.
They cannot be convinced otherwise.
Challenging a persona experiencing such vivid sensations may lead to intense anger.
The target will feel like they are being called a liar or delusional. 
The illusion is solely within the target's senses and nowhere else.

Illusions are affected by their complexity and believability.
The more complex the illusion, the more energy the mutant expends to maintain it.
A full-featured audio, visual, somatic, and olfactory illusion will have a short duration.

include::ROOT:partial$CH58_Table_Duration_of_Illusion.adoc[]

The less believable the illusion, the less likely it is to work.
Smells, sounds and fleeting images are believable, and the target may succumb to them without getting a psionic roll.
A Doppelganger expedition member attacking the target would get an enormous psionic roll bonus. 

The psionic roll bonus ranges from +1 to +6. 
A way to estimate this is by giving +1 per concept the target needs to deny.
Generating the illusion of good smelling food around chow time would get no bonuses.
The ref may not even offer a psionic roll to the target.
Having the target's mom (+1), who is from another planet (+2) and is deceased (+3), talking her would give the target +6 on her psionic roll. 

Mighty mutants can create elaborate lethal illusions in the minds of weak targets.

=== Information Eradication 

[horizontal]
Range:: 1h per Level
Duration:: Special
Frequency:: 1 per 5 Adjusted MSTR
General Bonus:: Combat Ratio +6, +15 when convincing others

The mutant can force a persona to forget something stored in her memory.
The memory loss is temporary and total.
The target will not even know that she has forgotten something. 
The thought, concept, skill is simply not there.
The target must fail her psionic roll to have the memory erased.
This mutation only works on organic personas.

The more important the memory the harder it is to eradicate it.
The more important the memory the shorter the time it stays away.

include::ROOT:partial$CH58_Table_Memory_Importance_and_Eradication.adoc[]


The value of the d6 roll corresponds to the memory's importance.
Regardless of the importance of the memory, documentation and recordings may still exist.
The mutant still won't remember, and the documentation will be irrelevant until she regains the memory.

Another complexity is whether, or not, the attacking mutant knows that a certain memory exists.
Information eradication allows a memory to be overlooked by the victim, but it doesn't allow the mutant to search it out.
If the mutant has the slightest idea that the target thinkspace might store the memory then she can eradicate it, but the mutation cannot be tad to determine what the victim knows.
Trying to make a persona forget a critical memory by eradicating its less important components will not work because these components will usually have a critical importance too.
Robots, computers, and mechanical recording equipment are affected the same as personas.
All inorganic information is given a random d6 importance.



== 21) Intuition 

// insert table 990

When employing intuition the mutant can ask questions of the nature &8220;is it safe to open this door?&8221;, and get a simple yes/no answer.
The only answers given to proper questions are yes or no.
If the mutant fails to ask the correct question a &8220;maybe-so&8221;
answer is given, and one of the mutant's daily uses is lost.
Incorrect questions are ones that are too large in scope, or ask for information rather than a yes/no response.

The chance of getting a correct answer depends on a save vs psionic attack.
The &8220;unknown&8221;
that is being pursued by the persona will get a random MSTR of 0 to 9.
The referee rolls a saving throw for the unknown, and answers the question correctly if the unknown fails the save (with a yes or a no).
If the unknown saves versus the intrusion no answer can be given.

The ref can adjust the roll depending on the type of unknown.
Campaign secrets have incredibly high defences.
Questions about personas have a defence to be equal to the MSTR of the persona.
For example, asking if a jewel is in a persona's bag would have a defence from 1 to 10, but asking if that persona stole the  jewel would have a defence equal to the persona's MSTR+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++If the referee is creative about the facts in her campaign it should be easy for her to avoid intuition becoming a campaign wrecking mutation.

The expedition will usually get together to ask a series of questions that could give the answer to life the universe and everything.
The referee must remember that she is the only one that knows everything about her campaign, and if personas are abusing this mutation the referee can make up some things on the spot which will make the game more complex than simple intuition can handle.

Consider the following question.
Will I (my persona) die if I go through that door?
The referee could answer either yes, or no, to this question without the slightest hesitation.
If the room behind the door is entirely benign she could respond &8216;yes'
to the question, because the persona will die eventually anyway, even if its due to old age.
If the room behind the door contains a fully operational heavy offensive combat robot then the referee could still respond &8216;no'
(not entirely without compunction), because going through the door won't kill the persona, but the combat robot might.
The referee must keep the mutation balanced so that it is fun for both the players and the referee.
Ideally intuition will be used to guide the expedition deeper into the mystery that they are following.

== 22) Knowledge Transmission 

// insert table 991

This unique ability allows the mutant to instantly transmit information from one creature to another.
The mutant can act as a repository for knowledge that she may not even understand.
The first step is acquiring the knowledge from a source.
The mutant may wish to transfer knowledge of its own to another persona, or she may wish to transfer knowledge from a third party.
Acquiring knowledge from another party requires the mutant touch the persona near its brain, in most cases this will be the head.

The information will be transferred to the mutant if the target fails her saving throw.
The thinkspace that contains the desired information will not willingly yield to the intrusion of knowledge transmission, and the transferee must fail her save whether she is willing to donate the knowledge, or not.
Information isn't given up easily by whatever is storing it.
Inorganic storage systems, robots and computers, have a MSTR of 13 to 22 (12 + 1d10), and organic storage systems, persona brains, uses the MSTR of the persona.
The mutant can copy knowledge once a day per 6 points of combined MSTR and level.

Once the mutant has copied the knowledge from the source it will sit in some deep recess of the mutant's brain until it is needed.
If the mutant has some use for the information she can attempt to access it herself.
The chance of successfully doing this is equal to 5 times her INT+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++If a mutant cannot access information for her own purposes it does not mean that she cannot transfer it into another mind.

Knowledge transfer from the mutant to a receiving thinkspace will erase the information from the mind of the mutant that transferred it.
Thus knowledge transfer will not result in an ever growing library of knowledge.
The receiving persona has a percentage change of successfully comprehending the knowledge transferred equal to five times her INT+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++The knowledge will only be lost to the mutant if she successfully transfers it.

There is a major restriction is in the number of times a knowledge transmission can be received by a persona.
A transmission can be received by a persona once a month for every point of adjusted INT.
The mutant may transmit her knowledge once a month for every three points of adjusted INT.
Mutations cannot be transferred, although all the information about them could be.
Abilities such as computer knowledge, or surgery skill can be stored, and then transferred to appropriate personas.

A certain persona in the expedition wants to learn an ancient language that another member of the expedition knows how to speak fluently.
The mutant touches the head of the persona that speaks the language and if the target fails her saving throw the mutant will have the language stored in her thinkspace.
The mutant will be able to use the language herself if she makes a percentile roll less than 5 times her INT.
This would allow the mutant to use the language until she transfers it to the other persona.
Even if the mutant cannot understand the language she will still have it stored until it is transfered to the other persona.
 

== 23) Levitation 

// insert table 993

This mutation allows the mutant to counter her own body wate against gravity by manipulating gravity and magnetic waves.
This ability is made most obvious by levitating upwards, and defying gravity itself.
Levitation also allows the mutant to safely lower herself into a gravity well defying the dangerous accelerations associated with falling.

Levitation does not allow for translational motion, and the mutant cannot use this mutation for flying.
The direction may only be up or down, and she must depend on air currents, or other devices, for translational motion.
The mutant can travel upwards or downwards at a movement rate equal to twice her regular movement rate.

When employing this mutation the mutant can function normally in gravities from zero to five gravities, by manipulating her wate through levitation.
The ability to compensate for high gravity improve by 1 G per two EXPS levels.
So a 6th level persona with levitation could function normally when being subject to 8 G.


Levitation will also assist the mutant's wate allowance.
When in normal gravity the mutant can use the mutation to carry her entire wate in equipment and not be encumbered.
So and 80 kg mutant could use levitation to carry 80 kg of equipment without any enucumbrance effects, regardless of her PSTR.
Levitating mutants may zoom away when hit with a kinetic attack, reducing kinetic damage  by half.
When hit the mutant will fly away 1-8 (1d8) hexes.

== 24) Life Leech 

// insert table 994

This mutation gives the mutant the infamous ability of being able to painlessly drain life force from a victim and use it herself.
In game terms this mutation allows the mutant to leech hit points from other personas by touch.
Each touch, or unit, of continued touch will drain 5 HPS (plus one per EXPS level) from the target, and add 5 (plus one per EXPS level) HPS to the mutant's HPS total.
For the remainder of this explanation we will assume that the mutant is first level and will drain 6 HPS per life leech.
If the mutant cannot touch the target then a successful attack roll must be made for  life leech to work.
If necessary the mutant can life leech through a sword or any other conductive material.

The mutant can continue to leech hit points from targets even when she is at full HPS.
A touch from this mutant will always drain 6 HPS from the target, and add 6 HPS to her HPS Total.
The mutant cannot exceed double her HPS Max with bonus leeched hit points.
Therefore a mutant with 34 HPS Max could leech a total of 68 HPS+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++These HPS function same as normal HPS. If the mutant sleeps, or falls unconscious, then she will return to her HPS maximum.
 Thus in the morning the mutant with life leech will have to seek out victims to hype up her life force.
Mutants with life leech can become very ghoulish characters indeed.

HPS life leeched from a target during combat will not be noticed any more readily than any other combat damage.
For instance a non lethal punch would do 6 HPS more than normal.
A pat on the back, or a gentle caress would also inflict 6 HPS* *damage on the target.
Life leech cannot be turned off.
If a persona were to fall asleep touching the mutant she would be dead in the morning.
Life leech makes the mutant a solitary figure indeed.
For any living thing that  touches= her will take 6 HPS* *in damage.
This includes veterinarians, barbers, and lovers.
If the life leecher is trying to secretly steal HPS from an unsuspecting target the target gets to make an easy (1d20) AWE attribute roll with a bonus of +1 per point of damage leeched.

== 25) Light Wave Manipulation 

// insert table 992

This mutant can manipulate electro-magnetic waves that fall under the spectrum of visible light.
She can warp these naturally occurring waves of light around herself to achieve a variety of effects.
By manipulating light the mutant can;
become invisible, visible, create darkness, ward off lazers, hide her shadow, change color, glow, makes parts of herself glow, etc.
Light wave manipulation does not allow the mutant to create images out of light, but it does allow her to alter the colour, luminosity and shading of any light that strikes her body.

Most often this mutant will use the very powerful mutation to make herself invisible.
This mutation has no effect on noises made by the mutant, and it does not alter her wate, or density.
An invisible mutant can be detected by radar, sonar, or any other detection device that uses parts of the electromagnetic spectrum other than visible light.
The general location of a mutant could also be determined if she were using visible attacks such as lazers, fusion blasts, or grapple guns.

Light wave manipulation is a personal mutation, however the mutant can envelope a certain amount of her equipment.
Light wave manipulation will function normally provided the mutant is not over-encumbered.
Light wave manipulation will malfunction if the mutant is over-encumbered.
Malfunction of this mutation could have her effects flicker on and off, or leave bits of her unhidden.
Light wave manipulation will not function at all if the mutant's wate allowance is in the lift only category.

== 26) Magnetic Control 

// insert table 995

Magnetic control allows the mutant to turn itself into a walking electromagnet.
The term magnetic is a bit of a misnomer since anything that is metallic will be affected by this mutation.
This includes alloys of metal as well as ferrous magnetic metals.
A tremendous attraction is built up between the mutant and all metallic objects within range.
If the metallic objects are not bolted down they will race towards the persona, and if they are larger than the mutant then she will fly towards them.

Objects less than half the mutant's wate will be pulled towards the mutant at a speed of 7 h/u.
Objects greater than twice the mutant's WATE will cause the mutant to be pulled towards the object.
She will move towards the object at 3 h/u.
The usefulness of this mutation is not immediately obvious, and the player running this mutant must be very creative to ensure that she is not crushed by an array of kitchen utensils, or end up being attached to the side of a moving van.

This mutation is particularly useful for disarming vast numbers of personas.
Since all objects within range will be effected weapons in the hands of other personas must make a save versus psionic attack, or be start flying towards the mutant.
Magnetic control can also be used by the mutant to increase her movement rate by 3 h/u when she is running towards something heavier than her.
The mutant has complete control over this mutation, and can turn it off as soon as everyone is disarmed, or if she is getting too close to something big and heavy.

The downsides to this mutation are mostly due to its indiscriminate nature.
The mutant will have objects approaching her from all directions within the radius of effect.
If something heavy should manage to get to her before she turns off her magnetic control it will get a attack roll to hit her.
If the object attracted to the mutant started more than ten hexes away will do 0-3 HPS of damage for every 5 kg of WATE.


Determining whether something is metallic, or not, is a difficult situation in a game where everything is based on black box technology.
If there is a dispute arising over the nature of a device's material structure then refer to the sphincter dice in http://expgame.com/?page_id=275[Chapter 16: Special Rolls].+++<figure id="attachment_9633" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9633" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[.size-medium.wp-image-9633] image::https://i1.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/babooshka-300x200.png?resize=300%2C200[studiostoks stock illustration.

== 27) Mass Mind 

// insert table 996

Mass mind turns the mutant into a psionic rebroadcast station.
Any mental mutation used within range of this mutant can be picked up amplified or redirected.
Mass mind will only work on ranged mutations that have a target in mind (no pun intended).
Mental mutations that require touch cannot be affected by mass mind.
This mutation will amplify almost any mental mutation to double its previous power.
Ranges, damages, intensities, durations, etc.
are all doubled by mass mind.
When the mutant is increasing the psionic power of the mutation she cannot redirect its target.

If another persona in her expedition were to attack an opponent with http://expgame.com/?page_id=36416-gyrokinesis[Gyrokinesis], the mass mind could double the duration, range, and effect of this mutation.
So the target would increase her revolutions per unit by 4 rev/unit instead of 2 rev/ unit, and this could be done for twice as long as the persona previously could.

Mass mind also allows the mutant to coordinate multiple psionic attacks on one victim.
This means that the mutant can channel the mental attacks of other mutants onto the thinkspace of the one target.
This channeling can be done voluntarily by the attacking mutants, or the mass mind can override the chosen target.

The mutant with mass mind can also override the target chosen by any mutant provided that the mutation is within range.
This does not allow the mass minding mutant to use the mutation herself, but she can redirect another mutant's mutation if that mutant fails a save versus mental attack.

If a mutant target a persona with http://expgame.com/?page_id=3646-cryokinesis[Cryokinesis] the mutant with mass mind could try and redirect the attack onto a different target.
If mutant using the Neuronegation mutation did not make her save versus mental attack then she would inadvertently attack the target of choice by the mutant using mass mind.
If the mutant is trying to direct mutations such as ESP she cannot read the target think space, but she can sure cause confusion for the esper.

[image:https://i0.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mechanical_medical_desat-300x200.png?resize=300%2C200[studiostoks stock illustration,300]](https://i0.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mechanical_medical_desat.png)

== 28) Mechanical Sense 

// insert table 997

This mutant has a way with machines.
She has an innate ability to understand anything mechanical, and can converse with machines as if they were living entities.
The more complex the machine the more developed the level of communication is.
The mutant could pick up a weapon and ask it what it had fired at lately.
The gun would answer telepathically to the mutant.
The chance of this working is equal to the mutant's MSTR+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++So a mutant with an 11 MSTR would have an 11% chance of talking to a specific mechanical device.

These machines can be organic or inorganic.
There is a 15% chance that the mutant will also have an organic mechanical sense.
An organic mechanical sense will allow the mutant to converse with the bones, organs and specific body parts of the living organisms.
The chance of this working is equal to the mutant's MSTR+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++So a mutant with an 11 MSTR would have an 11% chance of talking to a specific organic part.

A mutant inorganic mechanical sense  can operate as a second level mechanic regardless of what persona class the mutant is.
If the persona chooses to be a mechanic her EXPS earned are doubled until she reaches fourth level.
If the mutant has an organic mechanical sense she will function as a second level veterinarian regardless of her chosen class.
If the persona chooses to be a veterinarian her EXPS earned are doubled until she reaches fourth level.

The doubling of EXPS until fourth level means that the persona will double any experience award that she receives until she reaches her fourth level of EXPS+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++Thus a mechanic with inorganic mechanical sense that earned 732 EXPS for an adventure would get 1464 EXPS instead.
This experience point bonus would end once the persona achieves fourth level.

== 29) Mental Blast 

// insert table 998

The mental blast is a psionic concussion wave on the material plane.
It usually appears as a fluorescent yellow streak that flashes from the mutant's head.
The mutant can make this attack every second unit while in combat.
Mental blasts can be used simultaneously with other attacks, or while performing some procedure.
The attack will suffer no penalty, and will not detract from any other performance.
As long as the mutant has line of sight targeting is normal.
Mental blast can affect any target type regardless of its mental ability.
This attack does 2-8 HPS of damage, plus 1 HPS per EXPS level.
So a 4th level persona with this mutation would inflict 6 to 12 HPS* *of damage if the target fails a saving throw vs psionic attack.
If the save is successful the damage is negated.

== 30) Mental Control 

// insert table 1001

This mutation allows the mutant to completely control the body and mind of another persona.
To do this the mutant must make skin to skin contact with the organic target.
Once skin contact is made the victim gets a save vs psionic attack to repel the mental control.
If skin to skin contact is impossible then a successful attack roll will must be made.
If the saving throw is successful, then the mental control is negated.
A fail on the saving throw indicates that the victim is subject to complete mental control of the attacking mutant.

Mental control means that the victim's eyes become the mutant's the victim's mouth becomes the mutant's, and the victim's brain is controlled by the mutant (mutations too!).
The mind controlling mutant will function normally while controlling another mind.
To the player running the mutant it is similar to running two personas at once.
The victim becomes nothing more than an extension of the mutant.
The mutant can control the creature up to a range of one kilometer per point of adjusted MSTR+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++If the victim falls outside of this range of effect then she will break the mental control.

The number of thinkspaces that the mutant can control, and* *the duration for which they can be controlled is dependant on the target's INT.
Table 58.9: Control Break Checks__ __indicates how often the target gets to save versus mental attack.
If the save is successful the victim will immediately break free of the mental control.

The mutant can control any number of targets, provided their combined intelligence is less than the mutant's adjusted INT* *(INT plus experience level).
The mutant is capable of controlling only one creature with a INT greater than her own.
The player should be told the INT level of targets.
 Once she exceeds the maximum combined INT she can control the new target will always save.
A fourth level mutant with an INT of 14 could control 18 INT points worth of personas.
This could be two 9 INT personas, three 6 INT personas, but only one persona with an INT 18, or greater.

The more intelligent the controlled persona the more likely it is to break the mental control.
The most likely way that a persona will break free from mental control is on one of her mental control checks.
Mind controlled targets get repeated saving throws at intervals determined by their INT.
A successful saving throw at this time will free the victim from the control of the mutant.

Mind control checks will always take the mind controlling mutant by surprise.
Creatures can break the control by straying out of the mutation's range, being re-controlled by a stronger mutant, by being released by the mutant, by getting access to psionic resistant technology, or by dying.
When a mind controlled victim breaks free the mind controlling mutant will instantly know.

// insert table 999

Mind controlled personas are not mindless drones that the mind controlling mutant will send into slaughter.
For any damage that the controlled persona takes the mind controlling mutant will take also.
Damage taken by the mind controlled target is divided by four, and delivered directly to the controlling mutant.
This damage is psionic, and cannot be absorbed by armour or force fields.
If this amount of damage is a major threat to the mind controlling mutant she may release the mind controlled persona before any further damage is accrued.

If the target should die, or go unconscious, the controlling  mutant must make a recovery roll.
If the recovery roll is not successful, then the mutant will also fall unconscious.
All mind controlled mutants will remain mind controlled and function normally while the mutant is unconscious.
Only if the mutant dies will they be released from the mind control.

Mental attacks on the mind controlled target are also directed to the controlling mutant.
If the mind controlled target fails her saving throw the mental attack will then be directed at the mutant.
The mutant will get a chance to save before the effect is conducted to her.

If the mutant tires of her mind controlled charge she may dismiss it, but this means that the creature must save versus mental attack to be dismissed.
If the controlled creature fails this roll she will remain controlled for another hour, and may attempt another save then.
A severe dependence can develop between controlled thinkspaces.
It is possible for the controlling mutant to become just as trapped as the controlled victim.+++<figure id="attachment_5690" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5690" style="width: 243px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i1.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/meltingchick.636.png?resize=243%2C188[Melting into the backdrop.,243]](https://i1.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/meltingchick.636.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5690" class="wp-caption-text">+++Melting into the backdrop.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== 31. Mental Control Over Physical State 

// insert table 1002

This mutant is capable of conscious control over the normally automatic physical functions of her body.
If necessary her breathing can be made very shallow to reduce respiratory damage from gases.
Blood flow can be reduced to a cut limb.
Venous return from a poisonous bite could be reduced.
Hormones can be controlled to reduce hunger sensations, end fertility, or improve muscular strength.
Mental control over physical state will mostly be used to reduce malevolent effects on the body by mentally overriding the body's physiological controls.
The physical effects of anything are reduced to 25% of what is intended.

If a killing poison was supposed to inflict 80 HPS** **in damage then it would only inflict 20 HPS+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++If the mutant is supposed to age a year then she'll only age 3 months.
A paralysis effect would have one quarter the duration, and even one quarter the effect.
These benefits are attributed to respiration control, blood re-routing, hormonal adjustments and alterations in enzyme production.
Benevolent effects can be extended 4 times as long with this mutation.
This mutant heals 4 times as fast (4 HPS** **a day instead of 1), can extend a pharmaceutical's effect 4 times longer, and reduce the side effects by 1/4.

A mutant with mental control over physical state is unaffected by diseases, or cancers.
The more dangerous an effect the body is fighting, the more the mutant is required to concentrate.
This mutation is a mental one, however it cannot affect a psionic attack unless it is expressed in a physical effect on the body.
Subconscious mechanisms will override the mutant from enacting detrimental controls over her body.

== 32) Mental Defenselessness

// insert table 1003

Just as the title states, this mutant is mentally defenseless.
For some reason she cannot properly defend herself against mental attacks.
A mutant with this serious defect will usually have a long history of impulsive purchases, personal dependencies, and cult affiliations.
These points shouldn't necessarily be reflected in a stupid, or emotionally weak persona, but when subject to a psionic attack her effective MSTR is zero.
This does not mean that she does not get a saving throw, but instead of using her MSTR to defend her thinkspace she has no defence.
The mutant's mental strength remains the same, but when trying to save against psionic attack the mutant's MSTR is effectively zero.
The mutation is a pathetic and potentially lethal defect that does not count as a start up mutation, and allows a another mental mutation to be rolled.

== 33) Molecular Disruption 

// insert table 1004

This mutant can instantly convert matter into a low energy gaseous state.
Molecular disruption allows the mutant to obliterate solid objects by converting them into a billowing cloud of gas.
There is no saving throw against this attack.
The persona is capable of disrupting an amount of matter equal to her body wate.

There are two ways this attack can be carried out.
The first is a silent clandestine version.
where the matter can be obliterated without anyone noticing.
The second version involves a horrendous explosion that attracts all sorts of attention.
If the mutant wishes the attack to be silent, she must concentrate for five units before she can attack.

The silent attack mode requires 3 units of rest per kg of wate disrupted, and this rest must be complete.
The explosive version requires no concentration what so ever, and only 1 unit of rest per kg of wate disrupted.
The mutant can select the amount of wate that she wishes to disrupt, provided that it does not exceed her own body wate.
This mutation does not fully regenerate for six days, less one day per 3 levels of experience.
A third level mutant could employ molecular disruption once every 5 days.

Those objects that have a wate less than the amount of disrupted material are irrevocably destroyed.
Inorganic structures will take damage according to location of the wate disrupted.
Organic personas (of a normal bone/muscle/organ body structure) will usually be vanquished if more than 10% of their body wate is disrupted.
If less than 10% of a organic personas body wate is being disrupted then the target will take a 1d20 HPS damage per kg lost.
Inorganics (robots) can withstand losing up to 20% of their body wate being lost, but still take 1d20 HPS damage per kg lost.
The molecular disruption has no area of effect beyond the target.


== 34) Molecular Examination 

// insert table 1005

With this mutation the mutant can quickly determine physical weaknesses in any observable structure.
The mutant emits no special radiations to do this, and it is carried out by acutely active processing centers in the brain.
The building, animal, or whatever can be analyzed to determine the weakest point in view.
The mutant must observe the subject personally and be within range.
Thus molecular examination used against a building in a photograph would determine the weakness in the photograph (not the building), and molecular examination used on someone over a televid would find a weakness in the televid (not the persona).
If the subject appears to have no weaknesses, it may only have no structural, or tactical, weakness from that angle, and a change in view might change this opinion.
Thus the mutant must use molecular examination on a unit by unit basis.

All objects being examined will get a save vs psionic attack to see if they relinquish their weakness.
Buildings and other inorganic objects have a random MSTR between 0 and 9.
Military buildings, and such, may have a higher MSTR due to their defensive nature.
If the target fails its saving throw then the mutant will gain combat bonuses that represent this extra information.

If the mutant walks up to a solid rock and determines its weakness, she would increase her chances of fracturing it, rolling it, or balancing it.
The benefits are + 10 times AWE added to attack rolls, and + AWE to PT rolls.


A mutant with molecular examination, and a 14 AWE is in combat with a particularly well armoured alien.
Using molecular examination the mutant is trying to find a weakness in the alien's thick, scaly hide.
The alien fails her save and the mutant can add 140 to her attack roll, greatly increasing her chances to hit.
However the next unit the alien makes its saving throw, and the mutant gets no bonus other than her regular attack roll bonus.
If the mutant were a biologist and were trying to make an identification on the alien she would automatically add 10 to her PT roll.
If the alien failed her saving throw again, the mutant biologist would get to add her AWE to the PT roll also, for a total PT roll bonus of 24.


== 35) Molecular Phase Transformation 

// insert table 1006

This mutation allows the mutant to convert her present body structure into a homogeneous form of any of the three basic phases: solid, liquid or gas.
The mutant can convert her entire body, including bones, muscles, blood etc.
into a single phase type that contains mutant's functioning life force.
While undergoing the effects of molecular phase transformation, the mutant enjoys all sensory faculties, and all capacities of reason.
The mutant can only employ those mental mutations that are non-contact while phase transformed.
Physical mutations become disorganized and cannot function while transformed.

In the transformed state the mutant cannot carry, or manipulate, equipment of any sort.
The mutation only affects her body, and all the equipment, including clothing, she possesses either crashes to the floor, or sits on her statue.
There are exceptions.
For instance, taking on a solid form with this mutation could freeze the mutant's digit onto a button, or trigger that she is depressing.

*Solid*:The mutant's body becomes a statue like, motionless body of rock, and can remain in this state for two minutes (60 units) per point of MSTR plus level.
The mutant's Ovate and volume remain the same while solid.
Any damage delivered to the mutant will have no effect, unless the total damage per attack is greater than the mutant's HPS maximum, and then she would only take the amount of damage that exceeds her HPS* *maximum.
If the mutant's HPS maximum were 30 HPS* *she would take only 2 HPS damage from a 32 HPS* *attack.
Attacks must still make a successful attack roll before they can inflict damage.
The mutant's armour rating cannot fall below 500.
Any attacks that have special effects on organic organisms will not work while the mutant is solid.
Poison gases, radiations, and exposure to vacuum have no effect on the mutant while she is in this state.

*Liquid*:The mutant's body will pour out of her present form into a cohesive puddle on the floor.
The mutant's wate and volume remain the same while in the liquid phase.
Like all liquids, the puddle is affected by gravity, but the puddle can creep its way up walls if it wants too.
If the mutant wishes to move she can flow along at 3 h/u.
Attack forms like stabbing, clubbing, shooting, or puncturing will have no more effect on the mutant in this phase than they would on any other puddle.
Any attack that would heat up water will affect the mutant the same as a normal attack.
For instance, electrical, fusion, fission and lazer attacks would damage the mutant if a successful attack roll is made.
The mutant must use her unarmoured armour rating while in the liquid phase.
Exposing the mutant to a vacuum in this phase will have the normal detrimental effects.
The liquid state can be used to squeeze through cracks, or other tiny spaces, but the mutant must be sure when the duration of liquidity will end, and avoid getting herself cut in half.
The mutant can remain in the liquid state for 1 minute (30 units) per point of adjusted MSTR**.**

The mutant can generate a liquid pressure equal to her PSTR+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++The liquid pressure could be used to push open an unlocked door, however it could not be used to pull the trigger on a gun.
This also allows the mutant to attack--while in the liquid phase.
She can envelope targets with her own wate in liquid and drown them.
The target will be able to survive for 1 unit per point of CON+++<b>+++, +++</b>+++plus 1 unit for every time the target makes a successful PSTR roll.
Thus a target with an 11 CON could survive with her head enveloped by the mutant for 11 units.
It is expected that the target will struggle, and a successful PSTR roll will indicate that she has thrashed another mouthful, or beakful, of air, and her time to death is extended.

The liquid state of the mutant is very cohesive, and the mutant does not have to worry about mixing with other liquids, or being washed away.
If an attacker is trying separate the liquid phase mutant into separate parts the attacker must compete with the mutant's liquid pressure (PSTR) in order to separate the cohesive blob.
If the attacker over powers the liquid mutant then she may flatten herself out such that the room appears simply wet.
If the attacker resorted to a cleaning vacuum then a attack roll would have to be successful before any of the mutant could be vacuumed up.
The mutant will only take damage from this sort of attack when she reforms.
When in liquid state there is tremendous opportunity to reconnect into one blob.
If reconnection is impossible then the mutant may take a 1d20 per kg of herself that is missing.
The exact mechanics of this are left to decision of the referee.

*Gas*: The mutant can stay in a gaseous state for one minute (30 units) per 2 points of MSTR plus level.
While in the gaseous phase the mutant's wate remains the same, while her volume doubles.
This mutant can move at 6 h/u, and travel anywhere that a gas will be able to go.
While in the gaseous form the mutant would be able to steam her way through a mail slot of a normal door, but could not penetrate an airlock door.
Exposing the mutant to a vacuum while in the gaseous phase will have the normal killing effects.
While in this state the mutant can only be affected by lazer and energy weapons (fusion and fission).
The mutant can use her unarmoured AR while in the liquid phase.
Since the mutant appears as a cloud of smoke, or gas, she can still become a target if noticed.

When in the gaseous phase the mutant can generate a vapor pressure equal to her half her PSTR+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++The gaseous pressure could be used to pop open an unsealed box, however it could not be used to push a button on a dashboard.
This also allows the mutant to attack while in the gaseous phase.
She can envelope targets with her own wate in a gaseous cloud and suffocate the target.
The target will be able to survive for 1 unit per point of CON, plus 1 unit for every time she makes a successful DEX* *roll.
Thus a target with an 8 CON could survive with her head enveloped by the mutant for 8 units.
It is expected that the target will struggle, and a successful DEX roll will indicate that she has thrashed another mouthful, beakful of air, and her time to death is extended.
The target can also outrun the cloud if she moves faster than 6 h/u.

The gaseous state of the mutant is very cohesive, and the mutant does not have to worry about mixing with other gases, or being blown away in the wind.
If an attacker is trying separate the gaseous phase mutant into separate parts the attacker must compete with the mutant's vapor pressure (half her PSTR) in order to separate the cohesive cloud.
If the attacker overpowers the gaseous mutant then she may flatten herself out such that the room appears simply misty.
If the attacker resorted to a cleaning vacuum then a attack roll would have to be successful before any of the mutant could be sucked up.
The mutant will only take damage from this sort of attack when she reforms.
While gaseous there is tremendous opportunity to reconnect back into one cloud.
If reconnection is impossible then the mutant will take a 1d20 per kg of herself that is missing.
The exact mechanics of this are left to decision of the referee.

== 36) Molecular Phase Transmutation 

// insert table 1008

This mutant can transmute objects (other than herself) into any of the three basic phases: gas, liquid or solid.
This mutation will most often be used as a very dangerous attack, since partially transmuted targets will suffer tremendous damage.
The mutant can transmute her own wate in material.

When an entire target is transmutated she will suffer no damage, and will return to normal after 1 to 1000 units.
The target cannot function while she is transmutated, and will remain a marvelously sculpted statue, a quivering puddle, or a floating cloud of gas.
Although the transmutated target has no functioning mental faculties at all, she will function against attack as would a mutant that has voluntarily undergone http://expgame.com/?page_id=36435-molecular-phase-transformation[Molecular Phase Transformation].

Complete trans-mutations can be used to subdue targets, terrify the opposition, or preserve expedition members by converting them into a phase that protect them from harm.
For instance an impending depressurization would have no effect on a persona that was wholly converted to a solid.
The benefits of being in particular phases are discussed in this chapter under mental mutation http://expgame.com/?page_id=36435-molecular-phase-transformation[Molecular Phase Transformation].

When the persona transmutates a target a save vs psionic attack must be made.
If the save is successful the attack has been negated, and no part of the target has, been transmutated.
The mutant can partially transmute the target, converting part of the target into either a solid, liquid, or gas.
In most cases a partial transmutation will kill the target.
Inorganic targets that do not save are permanently transmutated to the chosen phase, and will almost always be destroyed.
Organic creatures can possibly survive a phase attack: damage is determined on Table 58.10, Effect of Partial Transmutation.
The damage inflicted is per kg of body wate transmutated.
So a target that gets 80 kg of her body trans-mutated into a solid would take 20d4 in damage.
If she were completely solidified she would take no damage.

Any target that is partially affected by this attack form will have a percent chance of completely transmuting, and not taking any damage at all.
The chance of accidental complete transmutation is dependant on the amount of target transmutated in kilograms.
See the Effect of Partial Transmutation Table for the percentage chance of complete transmutation.
The very large target that is supposed to have 80 kg of herself turned into a solid would have an 80 percent chance of completely transmutating and taking no damage.
This is incredibly inconvenient for the target, but it is better than being dead.

Multiple attacks on the same target present difficult problems for the referee to resolve.
Some guidelines for refereeing this situation include: total amount of target transmutated is included in the chance for complete transmutation;
previously transmutated wate can be transmutated, but it will not inflict additional damage;
mixing phases on a target doubles the chance of complete transmutation.

If a target dies when transmutated, it will remain partly transmutated, partly dead.
If the target survives a partial transmutation, the transmutated flesh will stay attached to the target's unaffected body, and will return to normal after +++<b>+++1 +++</b>+++to 10 units.
Remember that a complete transmutation will last 1 to 1000 units whether it was intentional or not.

== 37) Muscle Manipulation 

// insert table 1010

This mutation allows the mutant to seize complete control of a muscle, and the corresponding motor nerves that manipulate it.
This control attack can be made on any creature that uses limbs for leverage.
The mutant does not have to identify specific muscles and nerves in the target's anatomy.
This mutation will work on most alien races.
Muscle manipulation will not work on robots.
This attack could carry out any of the following actions, close a target's eyelids, cause one leg to trip another, make a wing stop working, force a fin to flag about limply, push an undesired button, pull a trigger to soon, not throw a grenade, or change targets unexpectedly.

Muscle manipulation is generally divided into limbs.
The mutant will always be able to pick a nerve trunk close enough to the spine that she can manipulate the actions required for an entire limb.
Another attack would have to be made if the mutant wishes to make two or more limbs act in unison.

As the victim realizes that her muscles are being controlled by an exterior force, and she is not suffering from some peculiar seizure, or cramp, it will become easier for her to throw off the control.
This is reflected by a bonus in her saving throws.
In the first unit of control, saving throw adjustments are given according to Table 58.11: Muscle Manipulation Save Adjustment.
A cumulative bonus of +1 is given for each successive saving throw after the initial unit of muscle manipulation.
Thus a victim that has been controlled for 5 consecutive units will receive a bonus of +5 on her saving throw.
Muscle manipulation is terminated when the mutant ends the control, the taget makes a successful saving throw, or the target manages to get out of range.
Muscle manipulation will also work on recently dead targets.

Muscle manipulation can be made to subtly hinder a target's performance.
Covert muscle manipulation will grant a attack roll penalty or a performance table penalty.
The victim will get a saving throw for this form of attack the same as any other form of muscle manipulation.
The mutant can exert muscle manipulations that can kill the target.
Such muscle manipulations are considered dangerous controls, and they include stopping cardiac, or respiratory muscles.
If the victim fails her saving throw, she will receive a CON roll.
If this CON roll is not successful then victim will fall into respiratory, or cardiac, arrest.
If the victim is not revived in a number of units equal to the victim's CON then she is dead.

// insert table 1009

== 38) Neuronegation 

// insert table 1011

This mutant is capable of shutting off the minds of targets.
The mutant completely cuts her target off from all and any sensory input.
Targets failing their saving throw versus neuronegation become simultaneously blind, deaf, and lose all olfactory and tactile ability.
Their brains are completely shut off from the outside world, and the target collapses into a mindless heap.
If an intended victim saves, the attack is negated.
Those targets that become a unresponsive pile of flesh will remain so for 1-6 minutes (30 units per minute).
A neuronegated target is completely immune to any form of mental attack that manipulates the thinkspace.
This mutation effects all creatures in a 2 hex radius up to the maximum range.

== 39) Phase 

// insert table 1012

This mutation allows the mutant to temporarily phase out of the material plane leaving nothing but a ghostly after image.
Phasing out can last up to one unit, after which the mutant's ethereal form will rematerialize.
Phase can be used to avoid hits, pass through walls, evade mental attacks, and dodge shrapnel.
Phase will only work on the mutant, and an amount of equipment that does not surpass her encumbered wate allowance.
If the mutant is encumbered and attempts to phase, all her equipment will crash to the floor.
Once phased the mutant moves at normal speed, and absolutely no other function can be undertaken.

Movement while phased is rather special since it allows the mutant to pass through walls, or doors at her leisure.
In order to pass through floors the mutant must concentrate on a downwards motion before phasing.
A phased mutant will not automatically sink though ceilings, fall through the bottom of rising elevators, or go flying out the back of high speed vehicles.
If she wants to though, she can.
When rephasing the mutant  will be moving no faster than her phased movement rate.
Therefore a phased mutant could jump out the wall of a speeding train, and rematerialize moving at her regular movement rate.
Even if the train is speeding by at several hundred kilometers an hour.
Conversely if a mutant phases through a wall on the same train she will rematerialize at the speed she was moving at, and not be wrenched from the train.

When phasing is used to avoid attacks the mental mutation will automatically phase out before any attacks can be made.
Attacks include any weapons, trained abilities, or physical mutations.
If an attacker is using a mental mutation then the two mutants have an initiative roll comparing their MSTRs instead of DEXs+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++While phasing, there is a 1 in 1000 (42 on kilodie) chance that the mutant will remain phased for 1 to 3 days.
If the mutant should solidify into an object or into a wall there is a 50% chance she will be pushed through in the same direction she was moving, and a 49% chance she will get pushed in the opposite direction.
The effect of the remaining one percent is left to the ref's discretion.+++<figure id="attachment_5692" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5692" style="width: 209px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i2.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/planalhideaway.642-209x300.png?resize=209%2C300[I am so out of here.,209]](https://i2.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/planalhideaway.642.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5692" class="wp-caption-text">+++I am so out of here.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== 40) Planal Hideaway 

// insert table 1013

A planal hideaway is a convenient time-space aberration that is generated and manipulated by the mutant.
The planal hideaway mutation allows the mutant to create an entrance into a strange 2 hex cube that can store items off of the material plane.
The entrance to the planal hideaway appears as a motionless, black, 1 dimensional plane parallel to the strongest local gravitational field (planet, star, or spaceship).
Even if the hideaway is opened in total darkness the entrance will always appear darker than the surroundings.
Closing the planal hideaway will make the entrance disappear, and no trace what so ever will be left where the opening was made.
The mutant can always find her closed planal hideaways.

The planal hideaway can be opened once (when created) and closed once.
When the planal hide-away is opened for the second time it will dissipate, and all objects in it will drop a distance of 1 hex onto the nearest solid surface.
The entrance to the cube stays in the same location, relative to nearest planet or star.
The planal hideaway will not kill its occupants by opening into certain death.
The hideaway will not release them onto the surface of a sun, nor will it release them under water.
An opened planal hideaway does this for reasons of its generation, and it should not be mistaken as benevolence towards its contents.
For instance, the hideaway could open just as a nuclear bomb detonates melting its contents (a referee would have to be particularly cruel to do this).

It is possible to leave multiple planal hideaways open, but the mutant must be present to close each one.
Another variation of this is opening a hideaway within a hideaway, however the mutant should be prepared for anything since the results of such actions are left to the refs imagination.
All planal hideaways will dissipate and disgorge their contents when the mutant dies.

The planal hideaway is excised from time and space itself.
Anything inside the cube will remain in stasis, and be completely unaffected by time, or any occurrence on the material plane.
Organic creatures can subsist inside a planal hideaway without food or water indefinitely.
Opening a planal hideaway 10 seconds or 10 years later will make no difference to the items stored inside it.
Personas will not heal, nor will they bleed while locked into the planal hideaway.
Boredom will be the greatest enemy, and sometimes combat can result from boredom.
Combat within the enclosed space of the planal hideaway will only be nonlethal, although any ammunition used will be considered spent.
Once the planal hideaway reopens everything restarts again.

The planal hideaway can be a chore for the referee.
For instance, what if the expedition jumps inside the planal hideaway and hangs around in the time-space aberration for about 10000 years.
Since time is meaningless they may hide inside it for 20 million years.
The trick for the referee is that they not only are outside of the channels of time, but they also have no concept of time.
This means that a 10000 year wait could feel like a 10 minute wait.
This sort of confusion will be accepted by the players provided that the hideaway at least allowed them to escape whatever they needed to hide from.

== 41) Planal Holdaway 

// insert table 1014

This extradimensional bilge follows along in the hex directly behind the mutant.
The planal holdaway is a timespace phenomena that functions as a storage compartment capable of carrying ten times the mutant's wate allowance.
In this case she uses her MSTR instead of her PSTR  to calculate the wate allowance.
The holdaway occupies no space on the material plane, and can only be found, or opened by the mutant.
The opening is 60 cm square, and appears as a 1 dimensional sheet of blackness.
When opened no contents can fall out, but the mutant can reach in and pull out whatever she is looking for.
As long as it fits through the opening it can be hidden inside the planal holdaway.
This planal footlocker will spill its contents if the mutant dies, or has a negative HPS** **total (dropping all equipment a distance of 1 hex) just behind the mutant.+++<figure id="attachment_5693" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5693" style="width: 249px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i0.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/magneticcontrol.631.png?resize=249%2C181[I am attracted to your car.,249]](https://i0.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/magneticcontrol.631.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5693" class="wp-caption-text">+++I am attracted to your car.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== 42) Polar Disruption 

// insert table 1015

Whenever this mutant is subject to extreme duress, there is a chance that she will turn into an electromagnet.
The following situations can be classed as extreme stresses: getting hit, being surprised, vehicle crashes, expedition personas dying, etc.
Whenever these stressful situations occur there is a 3% chance that the mutant will suffer polar disruption.

All metallic objects within range are effected by the polar disruption.
When an attack occurs, all objects that have less than half the mutant's wate will be repulsed from, or be pulled towards, the mutant.
So if a mutant's wate is 58 kg she would affect anything that is 29 kg, or less, in wate.
Any object with a wate greater than 29 kg cannot be drawn towards the mutant.
Metallic objects with more than twice the mutant's WATE will affect the mutant.
If she fails a save versus psionic attack she will be drawn towards the object.
If there is some difficulty determining whether, or not, some artifact has polar disruptable metallic content then consult the sphincter dice described in http://expgame.com/?page_id=275[Chapter 16: Special Rolls].

A normal polar disruption will involve 1-6 units of attracting, or being attracted to, metallic objects.
There is a 30% chance the mutant will have a repulsive (push metals away) polar disruption.
Movement for affected objects will be at a non-damaging 10 h/u.
Thus objects will hurtle towards the mutant at 10 h/u, but eventually they just gently pile up against the her.
A typical attractive polar disruption will snatch all the weapons with range of the mutant, and fly them towards the mutant.
Those items held by a persona will get a save versus mental attack using the holder's MSTR.


== 43) Power Drain 

// insert table 1016

This mutation allows the mutant to drain potential energy from inorganic storage devices (batteries) to gain HPS+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++The mutant can regenerate 10% to 60% of her HPS maximum for each battery that she drains.
Draining a battery has the same benefit for the mutant, regardless of the battery's storage capacity.
The healing amount is generated by the roll of a d6, where 1 is 10% and 6 is 60%.

For example, a mutant with 50 HPS* *maximum touches a battery to heal 20% of her HPS maximum.
She will add 10 HPS to her HPS total, and completely deplete the battery.
To convert energy to HPS the mutant must touch the storage device, or the artifact that contains the battery.
Once hit, the storage supply gets a save vs psionic attack, or it will be completely drained.
The mutant can only drain batteries.
This mutation has no effect on power cells (robots), fuel cells (vehicles), broadcast/psionic cells, or power generators.
There is a slight side effect mutation.
All batteries on the mutant to wear down twice as fast.
So whenever this mutant fires her lazer pistol it counts as two shots because batteries drain twice as fast around her.

There is a 12% chance that the mutant will have the reciprocal mutation, Power Source.
This mutation has all the opposite effects of power drain, and she can recharge batteries by losing 10% to 60% of her HPS total, and batteries around her will drain half as fast.

== 44) Precognition 

// insert table 1017

This mutant is psionically aware of hostility or impending danger.
If the mutant is asleep, the sensation of danger will awaken her.
A mutant can detect danger anywhere from days to seconds before it actually occurs.
This will usually give the mutant warning, but it won't always prevent what is about to happen.
This hindrance is not designed to render the mutation useless, but challenging.
Before a mutant can sense danger the threatening situation must be within range (10 hexes per point of adjusted MSTR).
Precognition will only work if the hostility, or danger, will personally effect the mutant.
If the mutant is about to bite into a poisoned jelly donut then precognition will stop her.
If another expedition member is about to shoot her she will be warned that something bad is going to happen, but she may still get shot.
This mutant will probably act a little bit more paranoid than usual.

== 45) Projected Sense 

// insert table 1018

The six basic senses of this mutant can be ethereally projected beyond the mutant's body, where they can function normally.
The senses that can be projected are awareness, hearing, sight, smell, taste, and touch.
So this mutant could project her sight into a locked room, and search it.
None of the senses can manipulate objects while being projected;
the projected senses can only observe.
While a sense is projected the mutant can still use her organic senses to their full capacity.
So this mutant could have two sets of eyes watching something.
This could offer the player two AWE rolls when her persona is searching an area.

Sight, hearing and awareness are still subject to damaging effects while in the projected form.
A flash, boom or mental attack could respectively injure the mutant's sight, hearing or thinkspace.
Projected awareness is analogous to the mutant's sixth sense, and it can deploy mental mutations.
The projected sense is where the mental attack will originate from tremendously increasing a mental attack's range.
If the mutant wants to project more than one sense at a time she must also project her awareness.

== 46) Protection Shell 

// insert table 1019

This mutant has a constant repulsion shell which can ward off various creatures or entities.
Aliens of the type repulsed must save vs psionic attack, in order to get within range of this mutant.
If the alien is trapped by the shell another mental attack save is given with a plus 6 bonus.
The mutant gets one roll on Table 58.12: Protection Shell Type__ __for every 4 levels of EXPS.
If the mutant rolls the same shell  type twice she gets a more powerful shell where the protected creatures has a penalty of -2 on the saving throw.
Generally fellow expedition personas will not be affected by the protection shell.

// insert table 1020

== 47) Psionic Defence 

// insert table 1021

This mutant has a higher than normal defence versus psionic attack.
Psionic defence functions against those mental attacks that manipulate the mutant's body, or mind.
Mental attacks are less likely to affect the mutant because her MSTR is doubled when she is making saves against psionic attacks.
Regardless of her MSTR a psionically defended mutant will not have a MSTR defence less than 16.
This mutation will also automatically defend against benevolent intrusion into the mutant's thinkspace.
A mutant with a 17 MSTR and psionic defence would have a 34 MSTR when saving versus mental attack, and a mutant with a 6 MSTR would have a 16 MSTR when employing psionic defence.

There are other benefits with psionic defence: the mutant cannot be sold anything she doesn't need, and any level of interrogation will be unsuccessful.
Mental mutations that employ normal physical reactions to inflict damage are not affected by this mutation.
So a mutant with psionic defence would double her MSTR when saving against pyrokinesis, but not when saving against mental blast.

== 48) Purify 

// insert table 1022

This mutation allows the mutant to purify substances by touching them with her bare skin.
The purification process will destroy any infectious organisms or toxic contaminants.
Picking up a piece of meat would eject toxins and neutralize any bacteria or viruses living making the meat safe to eat.
The same could be done for contaminated water, plastic, or lumps of gold.
The amount of substance purified cannot exceed 10% of the mutant's body WATE, and the mutant must touch the substance for 1-4 units.
This procedure will result in a 100% pure sample (which is immediately subject to recontamination).
It is left to the referee to decide if this mutation will destroy alloys, or separate other composite materials.
If it does this mutation could easily become an attack against inorganic targets such as robots, walls or artifacts.

== 49) Pyrokinesis 

// insert table 1023

This attack causes the extreme overheating of organic targets by manipulating their thermal regulation system.
Targets will start to dangerously overheat if they fail against a psionic attack.
Pyrokinesis has a cumulative effect, and the target's body can become so volatile that the friction of her cells bustling against each other can cause her to burst into flames.

The target takes 1d10 HPS of damage every unit of the pyrokinesis attack.
Each unit of attack there is a cumulative % chance that the victim will burst into flames.
The chance of the target spontaneously combusting is equal to the total damage inflicted by pyrokinesis.
If a target immolates the fire will inflict an additional 3d10 HPS of damage before extinguishing itself.
If it is important to know what part of the target's body immolated refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=316[C]http://expgame.com/?page_id=316[hapter 36: Hit Location].
Pyrokinesis ends when the mutant wills it to end or when the target immolates.
The target gets no saving throws other than the initial one.

Pyrokinesis is not limited to the spontaneous combustion of organic targets, it can also be used to cause flammable objects to suddenly burst into flames, burning fires to flare up, or explosives to detonate prematurely.
The most difficult thing to determine with the inorganic pyrokinesis is whether, or not, the target is flammable at all.
If it cannot be decided whether a stack of papers, a piece of furniture, or a weapon can be affected by this mental attack the referee should consult the sphincter dice described in http://expgame.com/?page_id=275[Chapter 16: Special]http://expgame.com/?page_id=275[Rolls]

Inorganic targets attacked by pyrokinesis will get a save versus mental attack using a randomly generated MSTR of 0 to 9.
If the target is flammable and fails its saving throw it will burn for 1 to 10 units (plus 1 unit per level of mutant.
The effect of the combustion is determined by the referee.

== 50) Repulsion Field Generation 

// insert table 1024

This mutant can create an undetectable field of nausea and sickening sensations.
Every time this mutation is employed, all creatures within the radius must make a successful save vs mental attack, or become incapacitated by nauseous.
If the save is not successful the creature will become violently ill, and unable to act, while within the repulsion field.
Creatures that do make a successful saving throw will suffer a combat penalty of -500 on all attack rolls, half movement (no sprinting or bolting), plus 10 DD penalty on all PT rolls, and halved attributes when attempting attribute rolls.
The same effect will be had on all organic creatures, whether they have standard physiological mechanisms, or not.

The repulsion field is a very effective device for immobilizing all those within the area of effect.
However the repulsion field is a difficult mutation to control, and it will affect any organic creature within the area of effect including both opponents and fellow expedition members.
The mutation will always have the maximum area of effect, and will last for the maximum possible duration.
Only as the mutant increases in experience levels will she be able to control this mutation better.
The mutant will be able to protect one target per 2 EXPS levels from the attack.
So a 4th level mutant could keep 2 of her expedition members from being impacted by the repulsion field.

== 51) Restoration 

// insert table 1026

This mutation allows the mutant to heal damaged organic creatures simply by touching them.
If the target creature is armoured in a fashion that makes contact difficult (like powered armour, or a space suit) the mutant must make a successful attack roll before healing her target.
Restoration can only return lost hit points, and cannot be reversed to inflict damage.
By touching the damaged creature, the mutant can heal a number of HPS in damage equal to her present HPS** **total.
A mutant with 13 HPS total** **can restore 13 HPS to herself, or another persona that she touches.

=== Seizure Projection 

[horizontal]
Range:: 1h per Adjusted MSTR
Duration:: Up to 5u
Frequency:: 1 per 4 Adjusted MSTR 
General Bonus:: Combat Ratio +4

Seizure projection allows the mutant to induce random muscle contractions in a specific target.
The initial muscle contractions are subtle and become progressively worse.
Eventually, the target is completely incapacitated by a full-body seizure (grand mal).

The first unit of this mental attack automatically affects the target.
The lack of coordination and spasms delivers the following penalties: movement drop of 25%, -50 on attacks, and -1 on anything else.
If psionic rolls are failed the neuromuscular dysfunction increases.
The movement and attack roll penalties increase by 25% and -50 for each failed psionic roll.
By the 3rd failed psionic roll, the target can no longer move and has -200 on her attack roll.

If the psionic roll is failed again, the target falls into a full-body seizure and goes unconscious.
This seizure will last 1-4 (1d4) minutes and require further recovery once completed.
The mutant can re-attack the target with seizure projection immediately. 

.*Example Seizure Projection Attack*
. No psionic roll offered. Move -25%. -50 Attack roll. -1 all else. 
. Psionic roll at -1. Move -50%. -100 Attack roll. -2 all else.
. Psionic roll at -2. Move -75%. -150 Attack roll. -3 all else.
. Psionic roll at -3. Move None. -200 Attack roll. -4 all else.
. Psionic roll at -4. Total body seizure and unconsciousness.

== 52) Sensory Deprivation 

// insert table 1027

This mutant can sever a target's brain from its various sensory utilities.
The attack is only effective against organic creatures, and the results can be quite nasty.
If a save vs psionic attack is not successful, the mutant can selectively cut off the target's brain from various senses.
If the mutant decides to sever the target's brain from all her senses (similar to http://expgame.com/?page_id=36438-neuronegation[Neuronegation]) the target will fall unconscious.
The creature will remain unconscious for one unit per two points of adjusted MSTR of the attacker.
During this time there is a 2% chance the target will succumb to non-specific internal organ malfunctions.
If internal system difficulties arise the unconscious target must successfully make a recovery roll, or die.
The mutant can also cause deafness, blindness, or a loss of tactile and olfactory senses.
The special effects of such sensory depravations are listed on Table 58.13: Sensory Deprivation Effect.
This attack has an area of effect covering a 2 hex radius, and can be directed at selected targets within it.

// insert table 1028+++<figure id="attachment_5694" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5694" style="width: 241px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i0.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sociabilityfield.647.png?resize=241%2C178[My aren't you sooooo nice.,241]](https://i0.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sociabilityfield.647.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5694" class="wp-caption-text">+++My aren't you sooooo nice.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== 53) Sociability Field Generation 

// insert table 1029

This mutant has an aura of good humour and friendship radiating around her.
The mutation automatically causes creatures to be unusually friendly towards this mutant.
Most creatures which enter the one hex radius are affected by this mutation.
Those creatures with INT between &8220;low&8221;
and &8220;average&8221;
(3 to 10) have an 80% chance of becoming friendly and amiable;
creatures which have intelligences between &8220;above average&8221;
and &8220;genius&8221;
(11-17) have a 40% chance of becoming friendly and amiable, other intelligence ranges(<3 and >17) are unaffected by the sociability field.

The mutation is the opposite to Hostility Field Generation, but this mutation does not make creatures automatic friends like the automatic enemies created by that mutation.
When creatures become friendly and amiable there is a +70% adjustment on any negotiation rolls made, see http://expgame.com/?page_id=288[Chapter 22: Negotiation].
This mutation has no effect over televids, or other communication devices.
The sociability field will not overcome the instincts of a hungry, or enraged alien, nor can it be used to pressure personas to place their lives at risk or carry out materially, socially, or personally suicidal acts.

== 54) Sonar 

// insert table 1030

This mutation gives the mutant &8220;sonar sight&8221;.
Sonar sight operates on the acoustic reflection of a variety of undetectable frequencies that are emitted from the mutant's skull.
The reflected sound waves are converted into images that allow the mutant to detect solid objects in a 360° radius.
Sonar allows the mutant to navigate in the dark, determine if holograms are solid, or not, and see through conductive substances such as smoke or water.
Holograms, phased out creatures and projections would be invisible to sonar, but invisible, or visually camouflaged creatures may appear as a blip.
Invisible or camouflaged objects can be detected with sonar, although an AWE attribute roll may still be required.
Sonar employs a variety of frequencies that allow the mutant to see around smaller obstructions.

Sonar and normal sight are interchangeable, however they are not equivalent in function.
Sonar sight does not give fine detail, and the mutant may be unable to tell a parked aircar from a combat robot, or the opposition from her expedition.
Sonar may not be able to function through some helmets, but eye gear or breathing masks will not obstruct its function.
Sonic attacks on the mutant (while her sonar is on) will do double damage and disable the sonar for 1 to 4 days.

== 55) Sonic Attack 

// insert table 1031

This mutant can releases a deadly burst of sonic energy.
The attack is a psionically adjusted version of the mutant's own speech.
For instance, a softly spoken word would be converted into a wall of ultra-high and ultra-low frequency sound waves that delivers damage to everything within range.
The attack will inflict damage on all objects within the radius of effect, regardless of whether they have ears, or not.
Any organic or inorganic objects that have enhanced audio sensors, such as sonar, will usually take double damage.

The amount of damage inflicted is determined on Table 59.18: Sonic Damage Range (conveniently provided below).
The mutant is unaffected by her own sonic attack, unless it is somehow reflected back to her.
The sonic attack has a radius (in hexes) equal to the mutant's adjusted MSTR+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++A first level mutant with a 9 MSTR would have a radius of effect of 10 hexes.
Organic and inorganic audio systems can be rendered inoperative if they take more than 15 hit points of damage.
If 15 (or more) hit points of damage is delivered a recovery roll must be made, or &8220;deafness&8221;
will result.
Organic systems will remain deaf for 1-8 hours, but inorganic audio systems must await repair.


// insert table 947

== 56) Sonic Reproduction 

// insert table 1032

This mutation turns the mutant into a walking digital recorder.
Perfect reproduction quality can be obtained on any audible sound.
Sounds can be memorized and replayed at a later date.
If the player makes a successful intelligence roll the mutant can replay an edited, or remixed, version of the recording . The INT roll should be adjusted for the difficulty of the remix being attempted.

Each recording can last up to two units per point of adjusted MSTR+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++Thus a 3rd level mutant with a 10 MSTR could make a recording up to 26 units in length.
The number of recordings stored cannot exceed the mutant's adjusted INT.
The major component lacking on these recorded noises is volume, extreme volume cannot be reproduced solely by the mutant.
Sonic attacks directed at the mutant can be reproduced, and fired back up to 1/2 range, inflicting half the damage that the mutant took.

== 57) Suggestion 

// insert table 1033

A mutant with suggestion can force an intelligent organic persona to make decisions that it normally wouldn't make.
For instance, the mutant could tell a victim that this isn't the parking space she wants, and if the victim fails her saving throw, she would not park there.
Or in the heat of battle the mutant may think-to an opponent that they don't want to use a particular weapon because they need to save ammunition.
The target would switch weapons if she failed her save.

The mutant can think, or speak, a suggestion to the victim.
Spoken suggestions are directed at a target, and the mutant makes her suggestion orally.
Spoken suggestions must be done in the target's native tongue.
Thought suggestions are directed at the target's thinkspace, and need not be done in the native tongue of the target.
The target gets a saving throw bonus of +2 against those suggestions directed at her thinkspace.

The more reasonable the suggestion, the more likely it will succeed.
Suggestions like: go kill yourself, kill your friend, and give away all your savings would certainly fail.
The referee can make saving throw adjustments (+1 to +6) depending on the gravity of the suggestion.
This mutation can be employed once a day per point of adjusted MSTR**.**

== 58) Telekinesis 

// insert table 1034

Telekinesis allows the mutant to psionically lift objects without touching them.
The mutant needs to concentrate on an object and it will begin to float through the air under the mutant's control.
Objects include anything less than half the mutant's wate, whether organic, or inorganic.
Telekinetically controlled objects are under the control of the mutant, and will not fall with gravity, or be blown by the wind.

The speed of target object depends on the adjusted MSTR.
Table 58.15: Telekinesis Movement gives the speed of tje target object.
Using telekinesed objects as weapons is not too efficient since part of the process of telekinesis involves negation of the object's mass, but a telekinesed objects will still inflict 1d6 per 3 h/u movement.
This is the damage inflicted on the target, and the damage inflicted on the telekinesed object.

Objects with a wate greater than half the mutant's wate simply cannot be affected by telekinesis.
Any object that has a WATE less than half the mutant's is susceptible to telekinesis.
Voluntary organic targets, and inorganic objects are assigned a random MSTR of 0-9 (1d10-1), and they must fail their saving throw before they can be telekinetically moved.
Involuntary organic targets use their own MSTR to resist movement.
If an inorganic target is being held by an organic target the MSTR of the holder will be used by the inorganic target.
Targets holding onto large objects get bonuses to save of +1 per 5 points of PSTR.
The target is moved through her center of gravity, and can still flail about its limbs.
A creature can break free from telekinesis if it happens to grasp onto a stable object and made a successful save.

// insert table 1035

== 59) Telekinetic Arm 

// insert table 1036

This mutation is an invisible telekinetic arm which can articulate anything from back-scratching to pick-pocketing.
The arm functions like a real arm, hand and all.
The arm is flexible and can pick up anything the mutant's PSTR can handle.
Although the arm is invisible, it must always be within sight of the mutant.
The arm will operate for a duration of one unit per point of MSTR.
Only one arm may be created at one time, but one arm per three points MSTR may be created each day.
The arm's range is dependent on the mutant's EXPS level, and she must watch her telekinetic arm at all times.
The arm is subject to damage.
If it should take more than half the mutant's HPS total the arm will dissipate.

== 60) Telekinetic Flight 

// insert table 1037

Telekinetic flight allows the mutant to fly through the air without the aid of flying devices.
She can defy gravity simply by concentrating her psionic powers.
The mutant can hover, skim along the ground, or soar high into the air.
She can travel at a speed up to three times her normal movement rate.
Thus a persona who could move 5 h/u could telekinetically fly at up to 15 h/u.
The mutant can only fly 3 times her base movement rate, and not 3 times any special movement rates, like bolting or sprinting.
While flying the mutant moves as if this were her normal movement rate, and the Driving Performance Tables need not be consulted for high speed maneuvers.

Telekinetic flight will work in or out of atmosphere, and in or out of gravity.
This mutation will not work if the mutant is more than encumbered by her equipment, or by her body wate (as in high gravity).
There is no decreased effect of telekinetic flight, it simply will not function if the persona is more than encumbered.
Encumbrance is discussed in detail in http://expgame.com/?page_id=279[Chapter 18: Encumbrance] and the effects of high gravity on body wate is discussed in http://expgame.com/?page_id=282[Chapter 19: Special]http://expgame.com/?page_id=282[Terrain].

If telekinetic flight is combined with other mutations that increase speed supersonic personas can quite unexpectedly arise.
If such personas are threatening game balance there are several steps that the referee can take to limit high speed activities, such as: the mutant's body is damaged at high speeds, she gets lost very easily (must make frequent AWE rolls), or she gets severe motion sickness (must make frequent CON rolls).

== 61) Telempathy 

// insert table 1038

This mutant can use telempathy to project moods or feelings into the thinkspaces of organic creatures.
The mutant can make other personas feel, pain, anger, love, hate, fear, etc.
For example, an ursidae could be forced into a frenzy by being made feel anger, a patient could be made to feel pleasure instead of pain, and a nervous Nellie could be immediately calmed.
The target must fail her saving throw before any effects can be had.

Telempathy can be projected in a 2 hex radius, with all targets in that area being affected.
The strength of the signal is diluted by the number of targets within the area of effect.
For every 2 separate thinkspaces within the area of effect each target gets +1 to save.
The mutant can accommodate one extra thinkspace for every 2 levels of experience:- If telempathy were being used on 4 targets within the 2 hex radius of effect every target would get +1 on their saving throw.
A successful saving throw will negate any possible effects.
Telempathy can also be focused on a single target, at a range of up to 1 hex per adjusted MSTR.
The thinkspace gets a saving throw vs mental attack in an attempt to negate the effects of telempathy.

Some of the less intelligent creatures are incapable of comprehending higher emotions, and successful mental attacks may have no effect.
Players also have no idea what has previously gone on in the target's life, and they have no way of exactly predicting a target's response to a sudden, unexplained and overwhelming emotion.

== 62) Teleport 

// insert table 1040

Teleportation allows the mutant to transfer her body and thinkspace from one place to another in an instant.
By merely visualizing another location the mutant can will all the molecules of its body to transfer there.
The new destination need only be on the, the material plane, and the teleporting mutant can travel over, under or through vacuums, oceans, planets, force fields, etc.
A mutant can teleport within a space vehicle traveling on its special drive, but cannot teleport from the ship to the material plane.
The teleportation always occurs in an instant, and as soon as the mutant decides to teleport her and her equipment will be at the new location.

Teleportation is particularly safe.
The mutant is reassembled in reference to the destination environment, and corrections for differences in velocity, pressure and gravity are instantly compensated.
For example, the mutant could teleport onto, or off of a moving train, and suffer no penalties for the change in velocity.
Teleportation has an instinctive survival defence built in, and the mutant is unable to commit suicide by teleporting into certain death.
For instance, teleport would not work if the persona was teleporting into a vacuum.
This instinct can be overridden if the persona makes a successful MSTR roll.
This does not mean that teleportation is completely without risk.

Each time the mutant teleports she must check Table 58.16: Teleportation Failure.
It is assumed that the mutation is taking all possible precautions to deliver herself safely, and no adjustments can be made to these values.
The mutation is affected by the amount of equipment that the mutant is teleporting along with herself.
If the mutant is more than encumbered then the chance of failure 5 times more likely normal.
The chances of teleportation failure are listed on the Teleportation Failure Table, and they are related to the familiarity of the destination.

A very familiar location would be a favorite room in the mutant's home, or some other specifically memorized location.
An outdoors location can never be classified as very familiar.
A familiar place would be the office at work, a casually known place would be a restaurant visited once or twice.
The other categories are self explanatory.

The chance of failure is compared to a kilodie roll, so familiar destinations are very safe.
If the mutant fails her teleport roll she has teleported into an object, the ground or some passerby.
This means that her molecular structure has been accidentally integrated with some other solid object.
This could be a wall, the ground, a tree, a coat rack, or a passerby.

The mutant can zap herself away to any location within 500 kilometers per point of adjusted MSTR.
Thus a 5th level persona with a 10 Msm could teleport 7500 kilometers away.
Teleport can be used once a day per 13 points of MSTR, but at least once a day.

// insert table 1039

== 63) Thought Imitation 

// insert table 1041

Thought imitation is used by the mutant to turn her brain into a mental process tape recorder.
By observing activities of a target the mutant can begin to create pathways in her own thinkspace that imitate the target.
This high level of modelling allows her to repeat physical activities, recreate mental attacks, and predict the actions of imitated thinkspaces.
To ensure that the mutant's brain does not become a useless hodgepodge of neural circuitry, imitated thoughts are quickly forgotten.
The mutant's thinkspace resets itself after a brief sleep, or any other loss of consciousness.

The mutant can memorize observed physical acts and repeat them flawlessly if the target fails a mental attack on its thinkspace.
The mutant could observe someone opening a complex lock, and then repeat the procedure flawlessly.
Obviously the mutant must be able recreate the action made by the target to within a reasonable degree.
For example a keyboard made for claws and tentacles may be impossible for an anthro with digits to use.

The thought imitation mutation will automatically synthesize and return any mental attack that is used on its thinkspace.
This applies only to mental attacks, and a mental mutation like Teleportation, or Time Stop cannot be imitated.
Nor can physical mutation.

The attack is returned to the attacker at one half the attack strength that the mutant was subjected to.
The mutant having its mental attack returned will always get a saving throw regardless of the description of the mutation.
If ESP were used on this mutant she would be able to read her attacker's thoughts with half proficiency and at one half the range.
If this mutant were subjected to Death Field Generation she would recreate the field at half strength.
The thought imitating mutant is still subject to the mental attack, but sends it back instantly.
This is often a case of mutual assured destruction.

Using thought imitation to predict a creature's actions is complex and time consuming activity.
To predict a creature's actions, the mutant must study the target for at least one melee (5 units) per point of the target's INT.
Therefore a target with a 12 intelligence would have to be observed for at least 60 units, or two minutes.

This baseline chance for successful analysis allows the mutant a 7% chance to correctly predict actions of the target.
Each additional minute (30 units) of observation increases the chance of success another 7%.
The chance of correct prediction is cumulative, so after ten minutes of study the mutant has a 70% chance of predicting a creature's actions.
The maximum chance for successfully predicting actions is 90%, and that percentage is reduced by 2% for every point of the target's INT.
This means that the maximum chance of determining the actions of a creature with a 15 INT is 60%.

There some is danger in repeatedly imitating another persona's thinkspace, and that is the taking on of certain personality traits of the imitated persona.
Usually these personality traits will be the most unsavory ones for the player.
A veterinarian may develop unhygienic habits, or a mercenary may develop a very high respect for living things.

== 64) Time Stop 

// insert table 1042

Time Stop has a bizarre effect on matter and physical laws.
The mutation arrests them in such a way so as to make it appear that time has stopped.
Absolutely nothing moves during time stop, except for the mutant.
She can function within the time arrested universe at her normal pace.
The scope of the time stop is as far as the mutant can think, yet it leaves no observable edges anywhere in existence.
Just this factor makes it a rare and powerful mutation indeed.
The only noticeable effect of the mutation is the havoc that the mutant wreaks in her immediate environment.
At the instant of activation of Time Stop the mutant finds herself in a hazy life sized diorama.
Falling objects are suspended in the air, bullets stop, flames freeze, and energy blasts hang useless.
There is no hot or cold, no up or down.
All machines, mechanisms, chemical reactions, and physical laws are paralyzed.
Except for the mutant.

What the mutant can get done during the Time Stop is what makes it such a powerful mutation.
Considering the cosmic scope of the mutation's effect the mutant actually has a very limited area of action.
The mutant can race around for the duration of the mutation essentially altering the course of reality.
She can lift any object up to ten times her wate allowance (temporal inertia keeps her from lifting anything greater), and by lifting and moving things she can become quite a dangerous opponent.
For example, she could gather up all the lazer bolts suspended in the air during a fire fight, and point them towards the opposition.
When Time Stop ended the lazer blasts would pursue their new targets.
She could pull the pins on grenades, and when Time Stop ended they would detonate.
She could open the door of a moving vehicle, carry a few personas outside, and leave them suspended there.
When Time Stop ended they would crash to the ground.
She could rush into a burning building, pushing the smoke out of the way, bending the flames, and rescuing as many people as she can carry.
When Time Stop ended they would instantly find themselves outside on the sidewalk.

Not even those mechanisms on the mutant will function normally in Time Stop.
She can fire her weapons and throw her knives, but nothing will start moving until the mutation ends.
A surgeon could stop time to make a delicate sewing procedure, but any electronic procedures would have to wait until after Time Stop ended.
Mental mutations do not work within the time space aberration created by Time Stop.
Although those effects already generated by the mutation will remain.
This includes: illusions, mental blasts, force fields, etc.

This mutation can be employed less than once a day.
Thus a mutant with a 12 MSTR could only use Time Stop once every second day.

== 65) Time Tell 

// insert table 1043

This mutant's brain contains a series of cyclical neural pathways that allow her to be a walking atomic clock.
She always knows the exact time of day, date, amount of time that has elapsed, duration of an event, or chronological order of any observed series of events.
Not only can she be pedantic about what happens when, but she can do so to several decimal places.
The mutation can be used as an internal watch, for timing cycles of a fusion drive, for knowing exactly when to act, or for detecting time space aberrations.
The Time Tell mutation is multi-tasking, and she can carry out any number of these tasks simultaneously.
When measuring longer durations of time the mutant must remain conscious, she may sleep, but she must not be unconscious.

== 66) Total Recuperation 

// insert table 1044

Total recuperation allows the mutant to instantly restructure her body to that of a previously undamaged state.
The mutation psionically repairs all her traumatized tissues by comparing them to an undamaged template stored in her thinkspace.
The mutation will not stop the effects of poisons, cure cancers, arrest infections, or regenerate missing tissues.
The most immediate effect of this mutation is that the mutant can instantly restore all her hit points.
When this mutation is employed the mutant's hit point total will instantly return to maximum hit points.
If the mutant is comatose (at a negative HPs total), and she has not depleted her Total Recuperation for the day, it will automatically activate.

Total Recuperation can also be used to delay aging effects.
When any aging is detected by the mutant's thinkspace Total Recuperation will quarter the effects (4 years is only 1 year).
This includes aging attacks and natural aging effects.
The mutant must be at maximum HPS to use total recuperation versus aging effects.
See http://expgame.com/?page_id=267[Chapter 13: Health] for more information.

== 67) Ventriloquism 

// insert table 1045

The mutant can psionically generate acoustic waveforms some distance from her own body.
These sounds are generated within the mutant's thinkspace, and there is no allusion to the fact that she is generating them.
Any noise that the mutant could make with her own voice could be created.
Ventriloquism allows her to very effectively throw her voice, but it does not allow her to synthesize any unique sounds.
Ventriloquism can also be used to obliterate minor sounds by cancelling out the waveforms that make up the noise at the source.
The mutation can also be used to subtly alter other sounds.

This mutation can be used to cause a distraction, make a shoe step silent, make a warning bell sound like an okay bell, or change the pitch of someones'
voice.
The mutant cannot generate brand new sounds, and can only change existing sounds in real time.
The effects of the mutation is be negated by a successful save vs mental attack.
The saving throw is given to any targets that may hear the real sound, and have an intelligence better than average (9 INT).

The voice, or noises, can be projected up to two hexes per point of adjusted MSTR+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++Once started, the mutation MUST be employed for one minute per point of adjusted MSTR.
If the mutant wishes to speak normally she must project her voice near her mouth and her lips will have to fake speaking.
If fake speech is attempted, saves vs mental attack are granted to all those listening to the speaker.
Making the save will result in disbelief of the speaker.

== 68) Weapons Discharging 

// insert table 1048

This mutant's thinkspace has a strong psionic drive to send mechanical devices into a state of lower entropy.
This means that triggered devices are capable of spontaneously activating when near this mutant.
Weapons discharge checks can only be made on inorganic loaded weapons like energy weapons (lazers), projectile weapons (crossbows), artillery, bombs, grenades and aerosols.

This mutation does not require the continual checking of all powered weapons within a two hex radius of the mutant.
The referee may make a random check at any time, but not more than once a day.
Checks are automatically made for each weapon within range when the mutant is surprised, hit, or subject to any other stressful situation.
If the check is positive, only that specific weapon being checked will fire.

There is a one half percent chance of  a weapon discharging for every point of the mutant's  down adjusted MSTR+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++A down adjusted attribute subtracts the persona's level from the attribute.
This result cannot be less than one.
So a 3rd level mutant with a 12 MSTR would have a 5% chance of discharging a weapon (12 minus 3 times one half).
Weapons that fire must make a roll to hit, (guns, lazers, crossbows) attack as though the mutant has fired them.
Table 58.17: Direction of Random Discharge is used only if the direction of weapon is not specified.


Weapons discharging need not always be setting off bombs, grenades, and guns.
It could also activate household appliances, vehicle ignitions, lamps, etc.
This mutation is a defect and does not count as a startup mutation.
The player should roll again.

// insert table 1047

// insert table 240

== 69) Weather Tell 

// insert table 1049

The thinkspace of this mutant is intimately entwined with the meteorological nuances of its environment.
This mutation functions in any environment that the mutant is in.
She can predict all the normal weather condition that one would expect, plus altering conditions in foreign environments.
Tides under the water, radiation surges in outer space, cave-ins under ground, or any useful bit of natural trivia that relates to environment.
Unexpected phenomena, like earthquakes, volcanoes, tidal waves etc.
can be predicted as well.
The mutant can give same day readings with 100% accuracy.
The chance of correctly forecasting the weather decreases by 10% for every day in the future.
The mutant can add 2 times her adjusted MSTR to the chance.
A 5th level mutant with a 15 MSTR would have a 90% chance of predicting weather events 5 days in the future.
