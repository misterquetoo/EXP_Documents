=== Absorber 

[horizontal]
Vocation:: None
Duration:: 120 Hour per Battery
Wate:: 2kg
EXPS:: 200
Value:: Special

Absorbers are capable of eliminating environmental components that are harmful to organic creatures.
The absorbers are industrial-strength air cleaners that counteract harmful agents like radiation, gas, and smoke.
The devices all operate on unknown electrochemical and mechanical principles that allow the referee to ignore any problems regarding the laws of conservation of mass.
All absorbers have the same specifications and abilities.
They eliminate the substance in question in a non-violent manner.

They have a three hex radius of effect in which the toxic material will have absolutely no effect.
For instance, a radiation absorber would reduce the effects of radiation within the three hex area of effect for the duration of the battery set.
The absorber will also clean up an area around itself by drawing in and neutralizing the offending substance.
The absorbers reduce the duration and area of effect to 1/4 of expected.
Substances like smoke, radiation and gas clouds drop to 1/4 of their area of effect and duration.
For those absorbers that can absorb damage, each HPS of damage absorbed counts as 1 hour of battery life.

Plastix is nearly impossible to weaponize, but it's effects can be tactical.

One kg of plastix will blow a 1 hex sized hole in whatever it is attached to.
Flying debris can be a problem for those caught on the wrong side of a charge (say inside a room).
Technically the plastix explosive will impart 1000 HPS of damage when it is properly applied, and 100 to 600 HPS when not.
If 1000 HPS equals a 1 hex hole, then less damage will produce a proportionally smaller hole.

To properly apply plastix explosive requires a mechanic DD4 maneuver.
Detonation of plastix explosives is easily accomplished, yet virtually impossible to achieve by accident.
There is a 5% chance that the plastique will be silent, doubling its value.
There is also a 15% chance that the plastique will be smokeless, increasing its value by 10%.
Usually 1-8 kg (1d8) of plastix explosive will be found.
The EXPS value of a plastix stash is still is 299 regardless of how much is found.

=== Psionic Headband 

[horizontal]
Vocation:: None
Duration:: Self Powered
Wate:: 500gms
EXPS:: 590
Value:: 9900611

The psionic headband amplifies an organic persona's psionic abilities.
The psionic headband must be close to the brain and contact the skin.
This artifact does not increase the persona's mental strength attribute.
The headband amplifies what the persona has when she is using it.

The effects of non-combat mutation effects are doubled by this artifact.
The persona adds 50% to the persona's MSTR when making mental attacks.
For psionic defence the headband will double the persona's MSTR.
The fortified defensive MSTR of the wearer cannot be less than 15.

A knite cannot wear a psionic headband. 
The knite's connection with the thinkspace must be pure and uninhibited by machines.

=== Recorders 

[horizontal]
Vocation:: None
Duration:: Self Powered
Wate:: Special
EXPS:: 250
Value:: 10000

A recorder is any device that records data.
These recorders record, store, edit, analyze and playback data.
The audiovisual spectrum is that which the is detectable by anthropomorphs. 
Other spectrums are added to challenge the players and move the story along.

Recorders are combined with a <<_detectors,Detector>> as well.
Some detectors will require expert improvisation from the players to make sciency fiction sense.

The recorder that also can record telepathy is worth 1000000.

=== Robot 

[horizontal]
Vocation:: Mechanic
Duration:: Special
Wate:: Special
EXPS:: Special
Value:: Special

The persona is in control of a robot.
Initially this will be a functioning robot that follows the instructions of the persona.
As the robot becomes more damaged, it will likely evolve into a referee persona.
Some robots, like Datalyzers and Hobbots, are cheeky from the start.

Regardless of what is created the persona is in control of the robot.
The exact robot type should be kept secret.
A robot should be played more like an amicable referee persona than a slave.
The robot shouldn't be used by the players to upset the balance of the game.

Jump to xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH11_Referee_Personas_Robot.adoc[Robots,window=_blank] to fabricate this interesting artifact.


=== Robotic Override 

[horizontal]
Vocation:: Mechanic
Duration:: 5 Uses per Battery
Wate:: 18kg
EXPS:: 2006
Value:: 994000

The robotic override is a focused AI computer that can reprogram the purpose, and ownership of a target robot.
The controlling data can be delivered one of two ways.
Irregardless, the robot must win a roll vs poison intensity 3-30 (3d10) or be controlled.
The robot uses it's intelligence attribute to combat the programming poison.
Mechanics can increase the intensity of the attack by making performance rolls.

Once controlled the robot is controlled by the user of the robotic override.
A combot could be forced to clean sidewalks and a hobbot could be used as a ramming device.
Persona robots get to make a control factor check every day they are under foreign control.
The more egregious the abuse, the more likely the persona robot is to break free from override.

Mechanics earn a bonus of +20 when making robot-related rolls using this device.

The robotic override will be the ranged version (type C) 42% of the time.

==== Full Contact Override (Type A Attack)
The mechanic must get up close and personal with the robot.
A successful type A attack roll must be made to inject the override coding.
If the pick like device makes contact, the robot must save or be overridden.
The pick does not have an 18kg wate, but the pick, cable and backpack do.

==== Ranged Override (Type C Attack)
The mechanic can beam the override computations from up to 10 hexes away.
The beam must lay on the target for  0 to 3 units.
An attack roll must be successful for each of the required units.
For docile, non-evasive, robots there is no need for the attack roll.

NOTE: *All robot expeditions pronounce overridden as overwritten.*

=== Rocket Rollerskates 

[horizontal]
Vocation:: None
Duration:: 1000 km per Battery
Wate:: 4 kg each
EXPS:: 99
Value:: 12000

Rocket rollerskates propel the persona along the ground faster than regular rollerskates.
The skates have a gyroscopically stabilized truck system which helps prevents crashes.
The skates are landlocked and do *not* fly.
They also require a reasonably smooth surface.
They are best used on proper roads in civilized areas.

This device only works in pairs (not impaired).
One cannot skate with just one rocket rollerskate. 
The plural is essential.

The skates are fast having a move of 31 to 50 (30+d20) hexes per unit.
When necessary their handling class is equal to the wearer's DEX.
Dangerous moves will require the player to win driving rolls or crash.

If the players so desire the rocket roller skate could be a rocket skateboard instead.
There is a 10% chance that a rocket roller skates will be an identically functioning skateboard.

=== Scopes 

[horizontal]
Vocation:: Mercenary
Duration:: 250 Shots per Battery
Wate:: 1 kg
EXPS:: 500 (Special)
Value:: Special

A scope is any device which aids the player's attack roll.
Artifact scopes range from a sight on a rifle to a gyroscope on a sword.
If the device helps increases the chance of damaging the target, it is a scope.
There are scopes for all weapon types. 
Every scope has a attack roll bonus and a specialization.

.*Scope Checklist*
. Scope Weapon Type
. Scope Attack Roll Bonus
. Scope Specialization

==== Scope Weapon Type
Each scope was fabricated to work with a specific weapon type. 
The scope is not interchangeable, and the technology only works on it's designated weapon type.
A scope designed for thrusting and striking weapons would not look like a rifle scope.
A scope for type A weapons could be a box on the hilt, or a bracelet.
The scope would then modify the motion of the blade to improve the attack roll.

include::ROOT:partial$CH48_Table_Scope_Weapon_Type.adoc[]

==== Scope Attack Bonus
The sight uses computers lazers, sonar, and servos and to create an attack bonus.
The attack bonus is not tied to the specialization and it is always added to attack rolls.
The to hit bonus is either +30, +60, +90, or +120.
The attack bonus is rolled on a 1d4 times 30.

=== Scope Attack Bonus
.1d4 times 30
****
Minimum is +30, maximum is +120
****

The attack bonus is added to the player's final attack roll.
The player's attack roll and the attack bonus can exceed the persona's maximum roll (MR).
For example a persona with a maximum roll of 710 could generate an attack roll of 800 with a +90 scope.

The value of this scope is equal to 1000 per to hit bonus.
E.g., a scope with +90 to hit is worth 90 000.

==== Scope Specialization
Scope Specialization is used to determine what special bonuses the scope has.
The nature of these effects are described in the paragraphs following the table. The EXPS and Value adjuster are included in brackets

Not using the scope as scope is fair game.
Special effects like darkness, smoke, and weather still work if the scope has a site.
So a weapon type C scope could be used to see in the dark even when not attached to a rifle.


include::ROOT:partial$CH48_Table_Scope_Specialization.adoc[]

Auto strike::
This scope compensates for virtually any error that the persona can make in combat.
Basically the persona needs to pull the trigger and point in the general direction.
Auto strike must have line of sight and cannot shoot through cover or concealment.
Obfuscation by weather can also thwart an autoscope.

The player makes an attack roll.
A win on the attack roll becomes a critical hit. 
Jump to xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH16_Special_Rolls_Critical.adoc#_critical_hit[Critical Hits,window=_blank] for more info.
Damage can be multiplied by 4 times.
A miss on the attack roll becomes a regular hit.
Auto strike changes the entire battle and campaign.

The player must always make an attack roll, at least to check for a weapon malfunction.
A weapon jam is a weapon jam, and a therefore a miss.

The value of this artifact is 10000 times the base attack bonus.
There is an *EXPS penalty* for using an autoscope. 
Any vocation suffers a minus 500 EXPS penalty on first use.
Combat experience is reduced to 10% of full experience when the autoscope is used. 
This combat experience penalty could also apply to other personas where the scope has undue influence.

Climate:: 
The climate scope compensates for all meteorological conditions except darkness.
The scope removes all penalties for wind, fog, rain, snow etc. 
The climate scope is worth double the base value of the scope.

Darkness::
This night scope cancels penalties for darkness.
The scope uses a combination of IR, UV, and whatever else helps the darkened attack.
The darkness scope does not give up it's position unless intentionally detected. 
There is no value bonus for a darkness scope.

Gravity:: 
The gravity scope allows the weapon to be unimpeded by 0 to 8 gravities.
In zog the scope compensates for kick back and protects its user.
This is the only scope hardened for exatmo.
The value of this scope is tripled due to the gravity compensation. 

Multi-scope:: 
The multi-scope is a combination multiple scopes into a single artifact.
So a multi-scope could be turned into a Climate and Darkness scope.
Each scope gets another roll on the attack rolls bonus section. 
So multi-scope made up of +60 climate and +90 Darkness would have a +150 attack bonus.
It would also attack cleanly in any weather or darkness.

No more than 3 scopes can combined combined in a multi-scope.
The maximum attack roll bonus is +200 for a multi-scope.

The value of a multi-scope is the combined value of the total scopes times 10. 

Pacifist::
The pacifist scope is a non-lethal auto strike scope.
The scope determines a target's weak vulnerable points.
Instead of delivering a killing attack, the pacifist delivers a debilitating attack.
A pacifist scope enjoys an attack roll bonus, as do all other scopes.
After a successful attack roll the players still rolls damage. 
The pacifist scope will converts the damage into a percent chance to stun the opponent.
Each point of damage inflicted will have a 2% chance of stunning the target for 0 to 9 (1d10-1) units.

A pacifist scope does not work with area of effect weapons or weapons of malicious destruction.
For example, this scope does not work with a fusion pistol, or flame thrower.

The value of the scope is increased by 1000000.

Range::
Range scopes increase the range of the weapon.
The range extender scope doubles the weapon's range and halves the decay.
The scope optimizes a projectile's decay by compensating for wind, and gravity effects.
So a weapon that normally has a range of 50 and a -100 to hit per hex beyond its range would have a range of 100 and -50 attack roll penalty per hex.
For type A weapons the range extender allows them to be thrown like a Type B weapon with a range of PSTR in hexes.
There is no increased value for a range extender scope.


Smoke::
The smoke cutting scope can sight through mist, fog, smoke, or other obfuscations.
The player has no attack roll reductions when using a smoke scope. 
There is no value change with a smoke scope.

=== Sincerity Machine 

[horizontal]
Vocation:: Nothing
Duration:: 1 year per Battery
Wate:: 1 kg
EXPS:: 230
Value:: 2000

The sincerity machine improves the persona's charisma by manipulating the voice.
A sub linguistic vocalization analyzer which modifies the persona's voice such that anything she says sounds nice.
The effect is excellent for negotiation, and increases the persona's CHA by 3-8 (1d6+2).
The sincerity machine can be altered to have a reverse effect which will get the expected reaction.
When combined with good looks, and intelligent wording, even coarse profanities can be accepted as compliments.
A vet will earn a bonus of +15 for all rolls on conscious patients.
This device cannot be used in conjunction with powered armour.

This charisma boost does not alter the persona's charisma attribute. 
If the machine loses power all charisma bonuses immediately disappear.

=== Superconductor Suit 

[horizontal]
Vocation:: None
Duration:: Until Destroyed
Wate:: 0.6 kg
EXPS:: 50
Value:: 130000

The superconductor suit is a skintight jumpsuit that improves her dexterity.
Typically the superconductor suit is worn underneath clothing or armour.
However superconductor suit is rather stylish on it's own.
The superconductor threads are woven with sensitive biotransceivers
The transceivers pick up nerve impulses, and bypass the regular nervous system along superconducting threads.
This allows the persona to react faster, and move faster, improving the persona's dexterity.
The suit has a DEX bonus of plus 3-8 (1d6+2) points.
This device cannot be used in conjunction with powered armour.

The persona's dexterity attribute is not changed by this device.
Once removed, or damaged, the persona returns to her normal DEX attribute value.
The suit is delicate and is damaged every time the persona is damaged. 
For the purposes of gameplay, the suit usually starts with 1000 hit points.
Once reduced to zero HPS it stops conducting. 

=== Support Equipment 

[horizontal]
Vocation:: Special
Duration:: Special
Wate:: Special
EXPS:: Special
Value:: Special

Support equipment is any artifact that is essential to the function of other artifacts.
Essential support equipment is useless on its own, but make useful artifacts useful.
Typical support equipment is: batteries, fuel, ammunition, and poisonous agitated bees.

Support equipment can be taken as a pure TOYs roll for the value of the artifact.
It is also reasonable to force the support equipment to match with other expedition artifacts.
For example, a player may roll extra batteries for her lazer pistol.
Or one persona may have the software for another persona's vocation computer.

Take a jump over to xref:iv-software:CH55_Support.adoc[Support Equipment,window=_blank].

=== Targeting Computer 

[horizontal]
Vocation:: Mercenary
Duration:: 50 uses per Battery
Wate:: 20.8 kg
EXPS:: 395
Value:: 900000

A targeting computer is used to aim artillery. 
Using binoculars connected to a box on the gun this artifact aims, arms and fires artillery.
The targeting computer either moves the weapon on a platform, or barks directions.

Non-mercenary vocations are able to use a targeting computer to fire artillery. 
They cannot fire on moving targets, and get no attack roll bonuses.
Under normal circumstances personas not trained in artillery cannot use it.

A mercenary using a targeting computer can target moving objects like vehicles or whales.
When firing on a stationary target, the mercenary gets an attack roll bonus of +100.
There is no bonus awarded when firing on moving targets.
Computer targeting is much faster than manual targeting, only taking 1-10 (1d10) units.
The targeting computer gives mercenaries and mechanics +20 on any artillery related rolls.

There is a 42% chance of the targeting computer being compatible with an artillery piece.
If the artifact is not compatible a mech or merc must win a 12 DD maneuver roll


=== Tesseract Box 

[horizontal]
Vocation:: None
Duration:: Approach Infinity
Wate:: Approach Infinity
EXPS:: 42
Value:: Special

A tesseract box is a multi-roomed artifact which appears quite small and mundane on it's outside.
A tesseract box will only occupy 1 hex in physical space.
Once entered the box can contain 100s of medium-sized rooms. 
Needless to say a tesseract box is a campaign altering or producing artifact.
It would not be uncommon to find other personas within a tesseract box. 
Such an artifact is worthy of a campaign or even anan entire sciency fiction series.

A tesseract box will have 100 to 1000 (1d10 times 100) rooms arranged in whatever fashion the referee sees fit.
This paradox of containment is maintained by the manipulation of time and relative dimension sequencing.
Any items brought into the tesseract box must be brought in through the single exterior opening, and that is a normal-sized door.

The box has incalculable wate, but does not tear apart local gravity.
A tesseract box cannot be moved by any external force.

It is absolutely immobile, but can be fitted with a xref:iii-hardware:CH52_Space_Vehicle.adoc#_special_drives[Special Drives,window=_blank] allowing it to travel.
The special drive can be in any of the boxes hundreds of rooms.
The special drive will only be taxed to move the 1 hex entrance box. 
This allows the jump ship to cross enormous distances.

The value of a tesseract box is irrelevant, because no owner will part with hers unless she is dead.


=== Timepieces 

[horizontal]
Vocation:: Nothing
Duration:: Until Time Runs Out
Wate:: Special
EXPS:: Special
Value:: Special

Artifact timepieces, watches are also calendars, thermometers, and altimeters.

The timepieces are self setting, and conveniently adjust themselves to new planetary systems.
Prolonged exposure to another planetary rotation will also reset the calendar.
All older chronological cycles can be recalled without difficulty.

Any artifact timepiece will automatically synchronize with nearby timepieces.

There is a 10% chance the timepiece is built into another another artifact.
Allowing for another roll on the TOYs.
For example the timepiece could be in a rifle, or a microwave oven.

=== Visual Aids 

[horizontal]
Vocation:: None
Duration:: Special
Wate:: 1 kg
EXPS:: 75
Value:: Special

The visual aids are a host of goggles that help persona's through darkness, smoke, or worse.
Visual aids are often called vizauds, vizaids, optical enhancers or happy goggles.
Some are kept on at all times, while others are only worn when needed.

include::ROOT:partial$CH48_Table_Visual_Aid_Type.adoc[]

Binox:: 
These are electronic binoculars that allow the persona to see further, and with greater detail.
The magnification can be adjusted, and the range of major objects will be given.
Binox are passive and cannot be detected unless being directly searched for.
Binoculars are worth 100. 

Flexiscope::
The flexiscope is a flexible light pipe.
It can be used directly to look around a corner or combined with another vizaud.
The flexiscope is worth 1100.  

Infrared::  
These goggles allow the persona to see things in the dark.
They employ infrared imaging tech to do so.
IR visual aids have a value of 500.

Macroscopic::
Macroscopic goggles use computers and lenses to increase the persona's field of view. 
The goggles are especially good for finding things on open planes, and exatmo.
They are flash protected and blinding attacks have no effect.
These goggles grant the persona with a +10 on any ambush detection rolls made.
Macroscopic goggles are worth 20000  

Microscopic::
These glasses are very much like microscopes attached to the eyes.
They allow the persona to zoom in on small areas, and expand the image thousands of times.
Microscopic goggles give a persona +20 on any miniature related rolls.
Binocular microscopic goggles are worth 10000.

NIX Magic Multi-Vision Visor:: 
The NIX corporation makes incredibly complex, and comprehensive equipment.
The multi-vision visor is so detailed that no one really knows how to use it.
All M2V2s will have infrared, binox, and anti-flash screens as standard equipment.
Variable visual aids include smoke cutting, x-ray vision, ultravision, macroscopic, and and microscopic.
There is a 17% chance that any other visual aid will be present.
For example, if the persona needs radar there is a 17% radar vision will be present.
The vision type may not be present the next time, but it may present the time after that.
Nix Magic Multi-Vision Visor is worth 10000000. 

Smoke::
The smoke cutting visor allows the persona to function as though there was no smoke obscuring her vision.
The scope works equally well with mist, fog, and other particulate matter.
The persona will still be asphyxiated by the smoke, but no visual impairment.
The smoke visor is worth 250.

Ultravision:: 
These goggles allow the persona to see things in the dark.
They employ ultraviolet imaging tech to do so.
UV visual aids have a value of 500.

X-Ray:: 
The x-ray goggles can be adjusted to see inside things at various depths.
They have a range of 1 hex and can penetrate up to 1 hex of hull metal.
These goggles are detectable as radioactive by canines.
Xray goggles have a value of 15000.

ZBGs::
The abbreviation G stands for glasses, and ZB are the initials of a universally infamous, cool chicken.
The glasses always appear as normal glasses, but when they detect the Kirlian auras of danger they go opaque (yes they will go black if something is behind the persona).
The glasses are special to nothings, and will count as 4242 EXPS.
ZBG vizauds have a value of 42042.

=== Waste Disposer 

[horizontal]
Vocation:: Nothing
Duration:: As Needed
Wate:: 15 kg
EXPS:: 859
Value:: 36000

A waste disposer is a completely safe disintegration device (or so the manufacturers say).
Waste is placed into a drawer, the drawer is closed, and the waste is disintegrated with a poof noise.
The drawer can handle up to 25 kg of waste at a time.
The disintegrator will open the drawer, and eject any living materials, or moving objects.
The disintegrator harnesses energy released from the previously disintegrated materials.
There will always be just enough energy for the next disintegration.
The waste disposer is designed to disintegrate itself if its casing is tampered with.


== Miscellaneous Equipment Parameters

=== Vocation 
Vocation represents the persona vocation whom this particular miscellaneous device was designed for.
If the vocation attribute indicates Mechanic, then the artifact is used by mechanics.
If the artifact vocation is labelled Spie, then it is an artifact for spying.
If the vocation is labelled None, then it sits in no particular vocation category.

=== Duration 
Duration indicates how much use the device can endure before the battery set must be replaced.
It would be unusual for a battery set to run down, but who knows, it may happen just when the device is most needed!
Other toys have a predetermined number of uses before the battery set must be replaced.
Single-Use artifacts usually consume themselves to reach their objective.
Artifacts with the duration of Power Source need to be connected to a continuous power source.
These are artifacts that require enormous power plants like nuclear generators, and hydroelectric dams.

=== Wate 
This is the wate of the device excluding batteries and other paraphernalia.
This value is added to the persona's wate allowance if she intends to carry the artifact.
If the artifact seems too heavy, the referee can adjust the tech level so that an acceptable wate is obtained.

=== EXPS 
The EXPS value is awarded to the persona who identifies the device.
If the device is vocation related she can earn an experience point bonus.

=== Value 
The Value is what the toy would be worth if it were ever correctly appraised, which is unlikely.
The values are also relative worth in the campaign to other devices that can be found.
It is expected that the referee will adjust the value of artifacts as she sees fit in her campaign.
