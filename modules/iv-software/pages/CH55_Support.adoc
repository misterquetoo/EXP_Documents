= Support Equipment

Support equipment is artifacts that exist to make other artifacts shine. 
Types of support equipment are batteries, ammunition, fuel, manuals, software and spare parts.
Support equipment does not include brassieres or jockstraps.
Support equipment does not have a function on its own. 
However, some support equipment is precious.

Many artifacts require support equipment to function: guns need ammo; detectors need batteries; vehicles need fuel; computers need meaning; everything needs instructions, and everything wears out.

This support equipment section exists to support players in scarce resource campaigns.
It is not a tool to render toys impotent and defeat a game's fun. 
EXP is the game of technological chaos, not the game of carrying defunct equipment.

== Support Equipment Type 

include::ROOT:partial$CH55_Table_Support_Equipment.adoc[]

== Support Equipment Types

NOTE: *Consider existing artifacts when generating support equipment.*

== Ammunition 
Ammunition is so essential to most weapons that it can hardly be considered support equipment.
Most guns are useless without ammo unless being used as a club.

=== Ammo Type  
Is there an existing weapon for the ammunition type to match?
If there is no existing weapon, roll randomly on the ammo type table.
This roll determines the type of ammo found.
A  weapon that uses batteries would have battery sets. 
A weapon that uses bullets would have magazines.
A weapon that has special fuel would have both the special fuel and the batteries.

include::ROOT:partial$CH55_Table_Weapon_Type.adoc[]

=== Ammo Amount
The number of ammo sets determines the amount of ammo found.
An ammo set is a complete set of what is needed to arm a weapon.
Ten ammo sets are entirely different depending on the weapon type.
Ten sets for a rifle with a 15 round magazine would mean 150 bullets.
Ten sets for a lazer pistol using one battery would indicate ten batteries.
Ten sets for an antimat pistol using two batteries is ten chunks of antimatter ammo and twenty batteries. 

include::ROOT:partial$CH55_Table_Amount_Ammo.adoc[]

.*Armoury*
An armoury represents an endless amount of ammunition.
An ammunition dispensary is not mobile, and the expedition does not get to carry it around.
An armoury could be a battery recharger or broadcast power.
An armoury could be an ammo dispenser or ammunition store.
An armoury conveniently justifies endless munitions for combat fun.

=== Ammo Attributes
Ammunition wate and value are listed with each weapon type. 
Ammo does not earn a persona experience points. 


== Batteries 
Many artifacts require a stored energy source to operate.
The most common stored energy source is batteries.
Batteries should make the game more fun by limiting powerful weapons and a sense of conservation.

This section serves two purposes.
First is determining the cell type and number of cells for a newly generated artifact.
The second is to determine the cell type and number of cells in a cache of support equipment.
For a generated artifact the player needs to roll <<_cell_type,Cell Type>> and <<_cells_per_set,Cells per Set>>.
For a support equipment cache the referee needs to roll <<_cell_type,Cell Type>>, <<_cells_per_set,Cells per Set>> and <<_number_of_cell_sets,Number of Cell Sets>>.

=== Cell Type 
The cell type determines the sciency fiction process that the battery employs to create electricity.
An artifact may require a specific cell type and number of cells to function.
Some campaigns will allow cell types to be interchangeable. 
Cell types should add fun to the game and not frustration. 

include::ROOT:partial$CH55_Table_Cell_Type.adoc[]

Gas::
This cell contains chemicals in a gaseous state reacting to create energy.
A gas cell will cease to function if exposed to extreme cold (like a cryogenic attack).

Liquid::
This cell contains chemicals in a liquid state reacting to create energy.
A liquid cell will cease to function if exposed to a vacuum.

Solid::
This cell contains chemicals in a solid state reacting to create energy.
A solid cell will cease to function when exposed to extreme heat (like fusion, napalm or sustained fire).

Plasmoid::
This cell contains chemicals in a plasmoid state, reacting to create energy.
The plasmoid has a failsafe that prevents its weaponization.
A plasmoid cell will cease to function when exposed to zero gravity.

Dynamo::
Internal dynamos manufacture the useable energies of this cell.
A dynamo cell will cease to function when exposed to high gravity.

Solar::
A solar cell converts light into energy and stores it for later use.
A solar cell can recharge itself after one full hour in bright light.
A solar cell will cease to function if exposed to a violent light attack. 

Magnetic::
A magnetic cell converts magnetic waves into energy and stores it for later use.
A magnetic cell can recharge itself after one full hour in a natural magnetic field.
A magnetic cell needs a natural magnetic field created by a planet or moon for recharging.
These cells cease to function if exposed to magnetic attacks.

Broadcast::
Broadcast cells are power receivers that convert transmissions from a power source into energy.
The receivers will cease to function if they are subject to electronic jamming or leave the broadcast range.
If the broadcast source stops transmitting, broadcast cells stop working.
The range of broadcast power is up to the referee.

Psionic::
Psionic cells tap into the Kirlian energy of consciousness to create energy.
The psionic cells drain mental strength to recharge themselves.
The psionic cell will make a psionic attack on the nearest persona, usually, the persona using the device.
If the target wins her psionic roll against a 3-18 (3d6) attack, the battery moves onto the next nearest consciousness.
The player generates a new attack intensity each time the psionic cell requires recharging.
The psionic battery will keep doing this until a persona fails her psionic roll.
That persona loses one point of mental strength, and the psionic battery has recharged.
If all the nearby personas win their psionic rolls, the battery will stay drained until a new mind comes in range.
The range of the psionic attack is one hex per intensity.

=== Cells per Set
The cells per set can be the number of batteries needed to operate an artifact or the multiplier for the number of batteries in a cache.
If you are generating a new artifact, the table represents the number of batteries required for an artifact.
For example, a mutation detector may have two cells per set.
Two cells per set indicate that those two batteries will operate the detector for five days.
If you are generating a cache of batteries, the table represents the multiplier for the <<_number_of_cell_sets,Number of Cell Sets>>.
For example, a battery cache with four cells per set and four sets would have 16 batteries. 

include::ROOT:partial$CH55_Table_Cells_Required.adoc[]

=== Number of Cell Sets
The number of cell sets helps determine the number of cells in a cache of batteries.
To determine the total number of batteries in a cache, multiply the cells per set times the number of cell sets. 
For example, a battery cache with four cells per set and four sets would have 16 batteries. 

include::ROOT:partial$CH55_Table_Amount_Batteries.adoc[]

.*Power Source*
Power source can indicate a receptacle or generator that powers the artifact.
If the artifact is mobile, there may be a charging station for the artifact.
A power source conveniently justifies endless energy for combat and research fun.

=== Powerpacks
Powerpacks are a collection of cells combined into one device.
Powerpacks have a cell type and number of cells to power any artifact with a powerpack plug.
So a power pack with 16 cells could power a four-battery lazer rifle four times over before expending.
A 16 cell powerpack could power a one cell mutation detector for 80 days. 
Powerpacks contain a number of cells equal to a support equipment battery stash.
To generate a powerpack the player jumps to <<_cell_type,Cell Type>>, <<_cells_per_set,Cells per Set>> and <<_number_of_cell_sets,Number of Cell Sets>>.

=== Multicells 
A multicell is a single cell that replaces an entire battery set. 
The player jumps to <<_cells_per_set,Cells per Set>> to generate a multicell.
If the player generates four cells per set, the multicell can replace four cells.
If an artifact required four solid cells to operate, a multicell with four cells could replace them.
A multicell does not work like a power pack, and a four-cell multicell cannot power a single cell artifact four times over. 
A multicell must have at least two cells per set.

=== Battery Attributes
All batteries, including multicells, have a wate of 0.1 kg (100 gm).
Power packs have a total wate of 2 kg regardless of the number of cells it stores.

A basic battery cell is worth 100 eps.
A powerpack or multicell is worth 200 eps per basic cell. 
A recharging cell is worth 1000 eps.
A recharging multicell or powerpack is worth 2000 eps per cell.
A psionic cell is priceless and dangerous. 
Late one morning, I made a table that says the same as this paragraph.

include::ROOT:partial$CH55_Table_Cell_Value.adoc[]

There are no experience points earned for batteries. 

== Fuel 
Fuel is designated for the engines of vehicles and spaceships.
An engine's fuel type is determined when the vehicle or spacecraft is generated.

How the fuel is stored is up to the referee.
A hundred tonnes of space vehicle fuel could require an entire facility to look after it.
Whereas a 100 kg of vehicle fuel  could be stored in drums.
How this is done is entirely up to the referee.
If your campaign is about fuel scarcity you can ignore this part of support equipment.
The story leads the rules, not vice versa

fuel vs battery.
scarcity vs plenty

.list of energy sources
. cells are for artifacts
.. powerpacks
.. multicells
. power cells are for robots

== Rationalizing all the fuel types


.organize into
. Basic
. Recharging
. Continuous




=== ROBOTS have Power Cells
Basic 

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Power_Cell_Type.adoc[]


=== INATMO vehicles have Engine and Fuel Combined

include::ROOT:partial$CH55_Table_Fuel_Type.adoc[]

=== EXATMO vehicles have Drive Types universal fuels

include::ROOT:partial$CH52_Table_Fuel_Type.adoc[]


=== Fuel Type 
While the fuel type is easily decided on Table 55.5: Fuel Type.
All the fuel types function in the same fashion.
A kg of solid fuel is the same as a kilogram of liquid fuel.
It is up to the referee to decide if solar or magnetic fuel systems need to be recharged.
For example the vehicle may need to bask in the sun for a while to recharge.
Broadcast fuel indicates continuous function within a certain range of the broadcast tower.
How would this work for space vehicles?
I would not want to stand next to a power broadcast antennae for a space vehicle.

// insert table 742

=== Fuel Amount 

// explain depot
// determined by inatmo or exatmo vehicle

However the amount of fuel found is more difficult to determine.
None of the vehicles in EXP are given a fuel capacity in either liters, kilograms, or solar cells.
This makes refueling them with a found depot a bit tricky.
There is 1 in 10 chance that a fuel depot will refuel spaceships.
This will indicate way more fuel than a regular vehicle depot.

=== Vehicle Type 

// inatmo vs exatmo
// specific vehicle type
// self powered = food

For a random vehicle fuel depot there will be 10 to 1000 kg (10d100) of fuel available.
The amount and type of fuel will decide how the depot is stored.
This may create some significant work for the referee.
Several hundred kgs of  liquid fuel could be stored in cans, in an underground tank.
While solid fuel could just be a pile on the ground.
The tank will hold 3% of the vehicle wate in fuel to determine a full tank.
So a Car that has a wate of 3000 kg would have a 100 kg full fuel tank and 300 kg of fuel would be give it 3 full ranges.
There will never be a enough fuel in a vehicle fuel depot to fuel a space vehicle in any way.

*Full range or Full tank = 3% of vehicle wate*

==== Inatmo Vehicle


==== Exatmo Vehicle 

For a random space vehicle fueling depot there will be 20 to 200 tonnes (1d10 times 20) of fuel.
Deciding a depot's fuel capacity in this manner will also indicate how compatible a vehicle is to the facilities.
Usually a space vehicle fueling depot will indicate a complete scenario, or site location, that the referee must prepare.
If a vehicle matches the fuel type of a space vehicle there is access to basically limitless fuel.
But how do you fill up a moped at a spaceship refuelling station?
Carefully.

== Manuals

The discovery of manuals for toys can completely shift the course of an evening of gaming, and possibly the course of an entire campaign.
Manuals have two basic formats: instructional, and repair.
The benefits of trying to identify an artifact in collaboration with its manual should be obvious.
Mechanics get their greatest bonuses when repairing devices with the aid of a repair manual.
The chance of a manual occurring with a toy depends mostly on the scenario in which the artifact was found.
Toys discovered in the rubble of some mutant's lair are not likely to be accompanied by repair manuals.
However, the unopened crate stolen from the cargo hold of an air car is likely to have a detailed instruction manual.


If a player has rolled a manual as support equipment then the manual will most likely be connected to one of her TOYs created in the same session.
This is called being nice.
There is a 1 in 4 chance that the manual will be a repair manual and not an instruction manual.
In EXP the two shall never appear at the same time.

Some brief instructions about manuals:
 They are valuable, and may be worth as much as the artifact itself.
 they can be massive, reaching several volumes in length.
 they can be small, built into the artifact itself.
 they can be incorrect.
 they will usually be a hardcopy or a fancy reader
 they can have a format.
See Table 55.6: Software Format

=== Manual Style

==== Instruction Manual 
The vast majority of manuals will be instruction manuals.
It may be as simple as a pamphlet (timepiece) or as gargantuan as a computer system (space vehicle).
Instruction manuals offer an http://expgame.com/?page_id=284[AID bonus] of +10 and assist the persona in learning and making the artifact work.
Some petulant referees may decrease the EXPS value of artifacts identified using a manual.
A mechanic will gain a PT roll bonus of +10 when working on an artifact with an instruction manual.

==== Repair Manual 
Repair manuals are less common than instruction manuals.
They are essentially useless to anyone other than a mechanic.
Repair manuals only offer an http://expgame.com/?page_id=284[AID bonus] of +2 to assist the persona in learning and making the artifact work.
A bonus of +50 on the performance table roll is granted to a mechanic when using a repair manual.

== Programming 

Software is programming for computers, but without the computer.
Software can be as valuable as it can be useless.
If the persona has no artifact to install the software on it would be reasonable to allow the player and additional TOY roll.
If the persona has an artifact that can be programmed and the player has rolled software it would be best to have the software apply to that device.
This called being nice.

Usually the program will be delivered by downloading it from another system via modem, or something more exotic.
+AI software will have a wate of 1 to 10 kg, and space vehicle software will have a wate equal to 1 to 10 kg per computer level.
The software formats should be equally effective, depending on the mood of the referee of course.
The format of the software is largely phenotypic fun.
Software will always work in its designated type of computer.
Software in EXP will never have a manual.

Robotic::
A robotic memory insert will  have software from either a class computer or an AI computer.
The software is prepared for insertion and integration into a robotic brain.
The software will give the robot the skill described by the program regardless of it's robotic type.
The robot will be able to recall the data whenever she wishes, or use the skill as she wishes.
The software will either be inserted directly into a port on the robot or nailed in with a sledge hammer.

25% of the time  the roll will be made on Table 55.8: AI Computer Software the remainder of the time it will be on Table 55.9: Class Computer Software.

== Spare Parts 

// repair and decay
// equipment damage
// creating spare parts
// random spare parts

This is more of a complementary section than anything else.
Rarely does a role-playing game get so involved in technology that it requires detailed rules about spare parts.
Spare parts usually enter into the game when some strategic piece of equipment (the one needed to save the universe) is in desperate need of repair.
Spare parts will always be related to some artifact existing in the expedition already.
Spare parts will appear as unidentifiable odds and sods that has a wate 25% of the artifact in question.
Spare parts will have no particular value.
A mechanic will gain +30 on PT repair maneuvers if spare parts are present.
