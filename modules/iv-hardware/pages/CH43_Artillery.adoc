[.s1]#Artillery is a specialized subsection of guns.
An #[.s2]#artillery piece is nothing more than a big rifle with #[.s3]#an area of effect.
An artillery piece is an extremely #[.s2]#dangerous piece of equipment.
Unless the referee #[.s4]#enjoys having her players roll up lots of new #[.s1]#personas she will limit the presence of artillery in #[.s5]#her campaign.
The artillery in this chapter are based on the#[.s2]# rifle types found in http://expgame.com/?page_id=339[Chapter 46: Guns].

== Building Artillery {.p1}

[.s2]#Each#[.s5]# artillery piece is adapted from a rifle #[.s2]#that has had it&#8217;s statistics altered to imitate big #[.s1]#guns.
Table 43.1:  Artillery Type is used to #[.s2]#determine what kind of cannon the artifact will be.
#[.s1]#For convenience the changes have been made for all the appropriate weapons.#

[table id=404 /]

== [.s6]#Type# {.p2}

[.s2]#Artillery has the same rate of fire as the basic gun type rolled.
Artillery modelled after a type D gun #[.s5]#could fire twice a unit.
Artillery modelled after #[.s1]#type C would fire once a unit.
Artillery modelled #[.s3]#after &#8216;special&#8217;
would fire 15 rounds a unit, with the #appropriate to hit rolls being made.

== [.s1]#Range# {.p4}

[.s1]#Artillery has both a maximum range, and a #[.s7]#minimum range.
The minimum range of an artillery #[.s1]#piece is 1/10 of the maximum range listed for the #[.s4]#base gun type.
An artillery piece&#8217;s maximum #[.s1]#range is 10 times the maximum range of the base #gun type.
If the rifle had a range of 80 hexes, it would have a minimum range of 8 hexes and maximum range of 800 hexes.
[.s2]#Minimum range is unique to artillery, and it means that it simply cannot attack anything closer #[.s1]#than that.
Most artillery would destroy itself, and #[.s4]#its crew, if it were used even at the minimum #[.s1]#range.
Targets at less than minimum range and #[.s8]#beyond the maximum range cannot be hit #[.s2]#accurately, although the large area of effect may #[.s1]#accommodate for the restriction.
The minimum range is included in brackets beside the maximum range.#

== Area of Effect {.p6}

[.s4]#The area of effect will be 3 times the listed #[.s5]#area of effect, or a randomly assigned area of effect of 2 to 12 hexes.
The value represents a radius of #[.s4]#effect taken from the hex that the shell lands in.
#[.s5]#Those artillery listed with a &#8216;random&#8217;
area of effect #[.s4]#will make a 2d6 dice roll to determine it.#

== [.s2]#Damage# {.p5}

[.s2]#The damage inflicted by the artillery will be three times that of the rifle that the cannon is modelled #after.
If only one damage range is shown on the [.s2]#base gun type, the artillery attack will inflict triple #that damage.
For instance a fission rifle inflicts 6 [.s7]#to 72 (6d12) hit points in damage.
Artillery modelled after this gun would inflict 18 to 216 (18d12) hit #[.s2]#points in damage to all targets within the area of #[.s5]#effect.
If the base gun has several damage types #[.s3]#the artillery piece will inflict three times the highest #[.s9]#damage type listed.
The full automatic rifle&#8217;s #[.s4]#damage is listed as 4-48, 4-32, 3-30, 3-24, 2-20.
#[.s12]#These damages are for different calibre guns.
#[.s9]#Artillery has its own calibre, and it is big.
The #[.s4]#artillery will inflict three times the largest caliber, or 12 to 144 (12d12) hit points in damage to all #[.s9]#targets in the area of effect.#

== [.s6]#Accuracy# {.p11}

[.s1]#The accuracy statistic of the rifle does not apply to #artillery.
To be able to operate artillery the persona [.s5]#must make a successful Performance Table#[.s13]#* *#[.s5]#roll to understand the #[.s4]#device, aim it, and then make a to hit roll.
Misses with artillery are left to be decided by the referee.
If a quick and dirty system is needed then consult #[.s1]#the Grenade Miss table in http://expgame.com/?page_id=304[Chapter 30: Grenade and]#[.s8]#http://expgame.com/?page_id=304[Aerosol Combat].
The listed table values are #[.s9]#multiplied tenfold, of course.
Personas without #[.s4]#artillery skill cannot attack, other than randomly, #[.s9]#with an artillery piece.#

== Magazine {.p2}

[.s9]#Artillery has a magazine.
The magazine size is #equivalent to the highest rate of fire capable by the [.s4]#base gun type.
An artillery piece modelled after a #[.s14]#type C base gun type would have a 1 round #[.s9]#magazine, so it would have to be reloaded after #[.s4]#each shot.
A fully automatic base weapon would yield an artillery magazine with a capacity of 15 #[.s2]#rounds, if it were fired full-auto, it would need to be reloaded each round.
Reloading of artillery depends #[.s1]#entirely on the skill of the firers, but it can never get #[.s9]#faster than 1 to 4 units per reload.
[.s4]#Energy artillery that requires batteries will employ some power plant source, or use 20 times #[.s1]#the number of batteries required by the base weapon #type.#

== Wate {.p4}

[.s9]#The artillery piece will have a WATE 75 times #[.s5]#greater than the base gun type&#8217;s WATE.
If the base #[.s4]#+++<i>+++gun +++</i>+++type has several wates listed, the largest one #[.s5]#will be multiplied by 75.
[.s4]#Base gun types that have a % ammo system #[.s12]#use the % ammo value for the WATE of their #artillery shells.
Artillery shells modelled after gun [.s4]#ammos which have a standard ammo WATE will #[.s9]#be 50 times heavier than the base gun ammo.
The wate of the ammo is shown in brackets.##

== Malfunction {.p4}

[.s2]#Artillery is 1.5 times more likely to malfunction #[.s1]#than the base gun type it is modelled after.
Artillery #being used by unskilled firers is 4 times more likely [.s4]#to malfunction than the malfunction chance listed #[.s9]#for the artillery.#

== EXPS {.p13}

[.s4]#Artillery weapons are worth the same amount of #[.s5]#experience as the base gun type.
#

== Value {.p12}

[.s5]#The value of the #[.s4]#artillery is equal to 100 times the value of the gun it was modelled after.
The value of the artillery #[.s5]#ammo, shells, pellets, or whatever is 25 times the #[.s4]#value the base gun type&#8217;s.
The Ammo Value is included in brackets.
#

== Random Artillery {.p12}

Roll on Table 43.2: Artillery Type to generate a random artillery piece to be found, to be built into a space vehicle or powered armour, or to assist in an expedition&#8217;s self destruction.

[table id=405 /]

== 1) Annihilator {.p14}

[table id=403 /]

[.s4]#The annihilator also completely destroys 600 #[.s5]#kilograms of matter.
Damage is rolled as 15d10 #[.s2]#plus 90.
The resulting explosion causes the area of effect attack.
The artillery requires batteries.
For #[.s3]#more detailed information see the base rifle type in #[.s9]#chapter 46, Guns.
A malfunction means this #weapon will explode like an antimat rifle in the firing hex.

== 2) Beehive Cannon {.p28}

[table id=406 /] + [.s1]#The beehive cannon fires a hive of ferocious insects at its target.
All must save versus poison attack or #die.
The poison intensity is a ridiculous 57 to 72.
This is rolled on 3d6 plus 54.
For more detailed information see the base rifle type in chapter 46.

== 3) Howitzer

[table id=408 /]

[.s5]#This is the classic long gun.
Fed by explosive shells and aimed by cranking furiously.
For more detailed information see the base rifle#[.s2]#type in chapter 46.
A malfunction is a weapon jam.#

== 4) Glacier Gun {.p30}

[table id=409 /]

[.s2]#The cryocannon freezes everything within its 6 hex #by 100 hex area of effect.
Each point of damage equals [.s1]#a % chance of being entrapped.
So if the attack delivered 25 HPS of damage each target would have a 25% of being entrapped in the ice.
The chance to break free is a Tough physical strength challenge.
Trapped targets will be cold and trapped until the glacier melts.
The glacier melts #[.s5]#in 18 to 180 units (18d10).
Damage is rolled on #[.s2]#12d6.
This weapon is also called a Cryo Cannon.#

== 5) Disintegrator {.p3}

[table id=410 /]

[.s5]#The disintegration cannon will disintegrate 3 to #[.s3]#300 kilograms of matter.
There is a 1% chance per #[.s5]#kilogram disintegrated that the attack will fail.
#[.s2]#Damage is rolled on 24d8, or with a direct hit 1d20 per kilogram #[.s1]#destroyed.#

== 6) Electron Cannon {.p3}

[table id=411 /]

[.s2]#An electron cannon&#8217;s colourful bolt and area of effect can pass through force fields #[.s4]#unhindered.#

== 7) Fission Artillery {.p35}

[table id=412 /]

The damage is rolled on 18d12.
For more detailed [.s4]#information see the base rifle type in chapter 46.#

== 8) Howglitzer {.p14}

[table id=413 /]

[.s4]#The howglitzer can be used to blast the opposition into smoking chunks or fire straight up for a glorious light show.
A more technical title would be a Full Auto Lazer Cannon or Flotto Lazer Artillery.
#

== 9) Howblitzer {.p31}

[table id=414 /]

[.s17]#The howblitzer is a rapid fire howitzer to blitz the enemy with long arcing carnage.#

== 10) Nuk-O-Matic {.p31}

[table id=415 /]

[.s5]#The fusion artillery blasts a 9 hex by 900 hex #[.s17]#swath of incinerating death.
There is a fusion #[.s1]#backflash that inflicts 18-180 (18d10) hit points in #[.s5]#damage to anything within 3 hexes of the cannon #[.s4]#(excluding those armoured or shielded for firing #[.s17]#the G.V.M.B).
This cannon needs batteries to #[.s14]#operate.
A malfunction with the expedition #[.s4]#eradicator will inflict 24-240 hit points of damage #[.s1]#to all within 15 hexes.
For more detailed information #[.s4]#see the base rifle type in chapter 46.#

[table id=416 /]

== 11) Mag Cannon {.p14}

[table id=418 /]

[.s9]#The  mag cannon is virtually silent when magnetically launching it&#8217;s payload.
This artillery is also called a rail gun.
#

== 12) Whale Gun {.p51}

[table id=417 /]

[.s4]#The grapple has a 5% chance per hit point of #[.s2]#damage of sticking into its target.
Damage is rolled #[.s1]#on 12d6.
The whale gun will be able to reel in its #[.s2]#target at 5 h/u.
Maximum wate for reeling in is 10 #[.s4]#tonnes.
For more detailed information see #11 #[.s12]#Grapple Gun, in chapter 49, Miscellaneous #Weapons.

== 13) Grav Cannon {.p3}

[table id=419 /]

[.s2]#The cannon delivers 3 to 12 (3d4) random gravities #[.s1]#to the area of effect.
Each gravity will inflict a d12 in damage.
The attack will affect anything with a #[.s2]#wate less than 1500 kg.
There are also directional #[.s5]#effects, and special effects in zero gravity.
This is #[.s2]#a zero gravity weapon designed to send opponents #[.s18]#flinging off into space.
For more detailed #[.s1]#information see the base rifle type in chapter 46, #Guns.

== 14) Garbage Cannon {.p28}

[table id=420 /]

[.s3]#The JOB cannon can launch 10 kg of anything #up to its maximum range.
If it is 10 kg of junk [.s2]#the kinetic attack will inflict 9 to 90 #[.s35]#His #[.s2]#in damage.
#[.s4]#The cannon could also launch 10 kg worth of #[.s12]#grenades, or poison gas.
For more detailed #information see the base rifle type in chapter 46.

== 15) Lazer Cannon {.p3}

[table id=421 /]

Zap zap.
Boom boom.

== 16) Miscellaneator {.p3}

[table id=422 /]

[.s1]#Miscellaneator is #an artillery sized version of an appropriate weapon from the [.s2]#miscellaneous weapons chapter (49).
Miscellaneator could be a huge black hole, a gigantic spinning wheel of death, or a #[.s1]#flare cannon (for use when stranded on a planet).
#[.s3]#The referee should roll on the Miscellaneous #[.s17]#Weapon Table until she finds an appropriate #[.s4]#weapon.
For instance, compucrafted sword #[.s17]#would be inappropriate, but compucrafted crossbow might well be.
As would rocket assisted #weapons.
The miscellaneator gets very insane very fast.
If this type of weapon would imbalance a campaign or mess up a milieu simply ignore it.
Story trumps die rolling chaos.
[.s2]#For more detailed information see the base weapon #[.s1]#type in http://expgame.com/?page_id=345[Chapter 49: Miscellaneous Weapons].
For scaling up weapons refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=333#building-artillery[Building Artillery] in this chapter#

== 17) Flame Thrower {.p56}

[table id=423 /]

== 18) Plasma Cannon {.p28}

[table id=424 /]

This rapid fire high energy artillery piece rains plasma explosions down on targets.
The plasma cannon requires batteries as well as a magazine of pre-cooked plasma shells.

== 19) Plastix {.p3}

[table id=425 /]

[.s3]#Plastix artillery is the bane of all troopers stormin&#8217;
in plastix armour.

[table id=426 /]

[.s1]#The protein disrupter has no effect on inorganic #[.s2]#targets, and is unimpeded by walls, force fields, or #[.s1]#spacevehicle hulls.
For more detailed information #[.s5]#see the base rifle type in chapter 46.#

== 21) Rad Cannon {.p28}

[table id=427 /]

[.s17]#The radiation cannon inflicts 9-72 intensity #radiation on everything within the area of effect.
This is a universally lethal dose of radiation.
There is no duration of effect, just one dissipating blast.
See http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#saving-throw[Saving Throws].
For more detailed information see the base rifle type in chapter 46.

== [.s38]#22) Slotto Cannon# {.p28}
