Reptilians have the taxonomic label of Homo Serpens.
All reptilians are covered in the expected leathery hide and have lizard-like heads.
Reptilians have a good variety of descriptions to choose from: salamanders, snakes, iguanas, alligators, turtles, frogs, t-rexes, brontosaurs, etc.
Reptilians are upright, bipedal humanoids which naturally possess no abilities other than those listed here.
For example, a frog-like reptilian wouldn’t be amphibious unless she rolled a mutation like non-breathing.


== Chameleon
A reptilian has an 8% chance of having chameleon-like powers which enable the reptilian to blend into the background.
This skin colour alteration will work 90% of the time.
Chameleon power is a defensive hiding ability which allows the reptilian to become virtually invisible provided that she doesn’t move while being watched.
The skill will not work if she attempts to employ it while under direct gaze.
Chameleon power will also succumb to sonar or any other special vision.
The persona must be completely naked in order to employ this ability.
Similar to mutation #6 chameleon power.

== Torpor
All reptilians can voluntarily revert into a trance-like state similar to an ursidae’s hibernation.
Once the reptilian is in this torpor, she cannot be awakened for 2-12 days.
The number of days unconscious is rolled by the referee and is kept secret from the players.
While in this state of lower metabolism, the persona will heal at a constant 3 hit points each day.
A reptilian can go into torpor by her own decision or automatically (as when failing a damage system shock roll).
In either case, the reptilian will heal at a rate of 3 hit points per day and remain unconscious for 2 to 12 days.
Reptilians will remain in their torpor for 2 to 12 days regardless of whether they are completely healed or not.

Reptilians cannot go into torpor if they have less than 0 hit points.
When this occurs, reptilians are dying like all other families.

The torpor condition lowers the reptilian’s metabolism and can be used to reduce the effects of poisonous atmospheres.
When in the torpor state, ingested and inhaled poisons have 1/2 intensity and effect.
However, the reptilian will still be unconscious for the full 2 to 12 days.
Corrosive, heat and flame attacks are unaffected by the torpor.
