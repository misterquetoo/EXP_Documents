Canine is the short name for Hominidae Homo Canis.
Canines are humanoid dog people.
A canine persona can select the looks of one of many dog types: poodle, terrier, wolf, jackal, dingo, fox, etc.
The persona remains a bipedal humanoid.
A canine would always have two arms, two legs, a torso and face.
The canines are humanoid dogs that are covered in fur and sport doggy tails.

== Radiation Sense
Radiation sense allows a canine to detect and identify radioactive nastiness.
The effectiveness of the radiation sense is determined by the persona's AWE and not the the type of dog.
For example, a poodle would sniff out radiation as well as a bloodhound.
Radiation sense does not convey any immunity to radiation.
Radiation poisoning is just as deadly to canines as other personas.

=== Detect Radiation
This canine ability allows the persona to notice radiation.
The persona can immediately tell whether the radiation is a point source or general radiation.
If there is a point source of radiation the canine can move towards the epicenter. 
The canine could also track a mobile source of radiation.
If there is a generalized background radiation level the persona can determine this as well.
The range of radiation detection is 5 hexes per point of AWE and radiation intensity.
The range is very far. 
The ability can be used to avoid poisoned wastelands, or track down a leaking fusion pistol.

=== Identify Radiation
Whether or not there is a radiation type is up to the referee.
Generic radiation is complicated enough to run in a campaign.
If the radiation type matters then the description might be something like: a weapon, a reactor, natural, etc.

The canine can immediately identify the radiation type if she is damaged by it.
Otherwise she must be within 1 hex per 2 points of AWE.
Once she is close enough there is a 5% chance per point of AWE to identify the radiation.
For example a canine with AWE 12 would have to get within 6 hexes of the source. 
She would then have a 60% chance to identify the radiation.
If she takes radiation damage in the process she will automatically identify the radiation type.
