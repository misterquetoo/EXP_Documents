= Robot Armour Rating
All bots have a base armour rating of 700.
It is important to note that armour rating values are the same for robots and all other personas.
A robot has no immunity from intentional damage because they are composed of special alloys.
A successful attack roll will do damage to a robot as it would to any other target.
Robots are different from biological creatures and damage differently.
