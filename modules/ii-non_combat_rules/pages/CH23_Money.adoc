[.s1]#The money chapter gives the referee a baseline to #[.s2]#work from when she creates a money system for her own milieu.
Personas can come across money #[.s1]#in two different ways: they start with it;
or they find #[.s3]#it during play.
The money that a persona starts out #[.s2]#with is dependant on her persona class.

== [.s3]#Kinds of Currency#

[.s5]#The most standard form of money is coins.
Currency #[.s6]#can actually come in any form: cards, chemicals, #[.s2]#credit vouchers, or paper.
Currency also has an #[.s1]#endless source of common names: bucks, domars, #[.s2]#cubits, credits, crillos, units, bytes, sense, and doll hairs.#

[.s1]#The standard unit of money arbitrarily chosen #[.s7]#for EXP is the electrum piece.
The value of #equipment is listed in electrum pieces, unless [.s5]#otherwise stated.
Other standard coins are coppers, #[.s6]#silvers, golds, and platinums.
Whether these coins are actually composed of their described metal or backed by some ephemeral reserve is up to the referee.
#[.s2]# The coins are all the same size and wate of a Canadian quarter dollar (25 gms).
So every 42 #[.s1]#coins would have a wate of about 1 kilogram.
It is #[.s3]#recommended that the referee always select her own #[.s6]#money format, and make the coin a metric wate.
#[.s7]#Each coin type has an abbreviation and an #[.s2]#individual value (relative to the electrum piece).
#Consult Table 23.1: Currency Type for an [.s1]#explanation.

== Barter

[.s3]#If your milieu has currency you are already implying #[.s2]#a certain level of a cohesive society.
The most #likely form of exchange for a technologically [.s7]#collapsed society would be #[.s6]#barter.
#[.s7]#Currency #[.s1]#represents a cross society acceptance of a substance [.s2]#which is equivalent in all bartering situations.
I #will not, and probably could not, offer any [.s6]#suggestions on how to run a bartering system for #[.s1]#your campaign.
The bartering system does conjure #[.s6]#up an infinite supply of role-playing situations.
If #[.s2]#barter is being used the ref should be happy to #[.s1]#know that the values of all equipment are relative, #[.s3]#and the assigned values do not represent fluctuations due to #[.s2]#supply and demand.##

== [.s3]#Real Money#

[.s2]#Hypothetical gaming money cannot be converted to present day dollars, yen, pounds, or drachma.
The world&#8217;s money market is hairy enough, let #[.s6]#alone trying to create a conversion procedure for #non-existent equipment.
Even if a conversion [.s6]#procedure did exist it would be made obsolete by #[.s2]#inflation or deflation.
If the procedure included #[.s3]#inflation/deflation then supply and demand would #upset it.
The complexities are endless.
Finally, [.s1]#how many tech level 22 fusion pistols do you have #[.s2]#around the planet which can be compared for a #[.s4]#conversion to a present day dollar value?
Not #many.
