The robot persona's wate allowance depends on both her physical strength prime and her physical strength score. 
Wate allowance is one area where robots have an advantage over organic personas with the same attribute score.

A robot with a 3 PSTR prime and a 17 PSTR score has a wate allowance of 75 kgs.
Beyond 75 kgs of equipment, the robot will suffer movement penalties like all other personas.
