Charisma is charm, looks and sociability all combined into one value.
A high charisma represents a high proficiency at getting along with other personas.
This attribute is a universal so any persona with a high CHA would be socially adept.
A personaâ€™s charisma is very important for inter-persona interactions.

Anthro charisma is composed of voice, posture, healthy skin, eye contact, 
Alien charisma is composed of coat texture, vocalisation, adornments etc.
Robot charisma is composed of speaker quality, detailing, lighting, trim and programming.

CHA improves the persona's chances in promotions, sales, leading, and negotiating.
CHA can influence role-playing, and does not replace role-playing.
A persona with a high CHA should not avoid opportunities to role-play.
CHA does not influence the behaviour of the persona. 
A persona with a negative CHA may be kind and considerate.

Charisma is the only attribute that can fall below zero and not kill the persona.
Burns, scars, mutations, limps, etc. may reduce a persona's CHA.
However the reaction of other personas to a low CHA may be fatal.
