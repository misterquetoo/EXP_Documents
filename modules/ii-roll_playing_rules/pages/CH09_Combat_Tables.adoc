The Combat Table (CT) is an essential part of the persona record sheet and tactical combat system.
The Combat Table combines all the of the persona's bonuses in one place.
Attribute bonuses, level bonuses, damage bonuses are on one table.

An description of each element of the combat table is given xref::CH27_Tactical_Combat.adoc[here].
This includes details about attack types, proficiencies, bonuses and adjustments.

// why is damage an adjustment and to hit is a bonus. should it not be DB damage bonus.
 
== Calculating Combat Tables
Anthros, robots and aliens all calculate a combat table. 
The differences between the families are explained in each section of the combat table.

=== Anthro Combat Table
The anthro attribute component of the combat table is based on the persona's attributes.
The anthro level component of the combat table is vocation dependent.
If an alien persona has a vocation they would calculate a combat table from this section.











The important components of the combat table are
. Bonus Proficient (BP)
. Bonus Non-proficient (BNP)
. Maximum Roll (MR)
. Damage Adjustment (DA).


The player must record each of these values for each weapon type.
Weapon types A, B, and C will have its own BP, BNP, MR, and DA.
These 12 values, even if they are zero, should be recorded on a three row by four column matrix called combat table.
Combat table will be cumbersome at first.
Once players become more familiar with the table it will reveal itself is a simple and efficient way to store the persona's combat bonuses.

There are no tables and no reference charts;
simply at the appropriate bonus to the kilodie roll and see if it is higher than the target's armour rating.

// insert table 137

== Bonus Proficient (BP)
A bonus is anything that adds to the chance of success of an attack.
All bonuses increase the chance of the to-hit roll being successful because the value is added to the roll.
Proficient indicates that the persona is skilled at using a certain weapon.
The BP is added to any to-hit roll made by a player when her persona is attacking with a weapon she is proficient with.
The roll to hit is increased and thus the persona's chances to inflict damage are increased also.

=== Attribute Component BP
Certain weapon types (A, B, or C) are best employed by personas with specific attributes.
There is no rule that says a physically weak persona cannot wield a sword but a physically strong persona will be much more effective.

The attribute bonuses are not specific to each conceivable weapon in existence but they are modeled around the weapon types described earlier.
The attributes that improve each weapon type are reasonably self explanatory.
Some justifications of how they improve each weapon type's BP are given.

To calculate the persona's attribute bonus component of the BP refer to Table 9.1: Attribute to Hit Bonus.
A persona with a high PSTR can increase her chances two-hit when attacking with the type A weapon.
Type A weapons depend on force to inflict damage.
Physically stronger personas can generate greater force which in turn requires less contact to impart damage to the target, hence the chance of hitting is increased.
High DEX values increase the persona's ability to hit with projectile or aiming weapons.
Eye-hand coordination, range judgment, and balance of the major components of both the DEX attribute and aiming.
Weapon Types B and C are dominantly projectile weapons and the major component of their attribute bonus is from dexterity.
When a persona uses type D, E, F, or special weapons.
The player will use the type G -to hit bonus.

// insert table 139

The attribute bonus is the major component of the first level persona's BP.
A persona named Bob Too has the following attributes: AWE 10, DEX 16, INT 12, and PSTR 12.
According to the Attribute To Hit Bonus table, Bob Too's attribute bonuses are calculated below on the Example Attribute To Hit Bonus table.

// insert table 140

Bob Too's player would add 110 to her to-hit roll whenever the persona was using a type B weapon.
If any of Bob Too's attributes were to change, then her combat table would be altered also.
It shouldn't be necessary to recalculate the entire combat table and simple subtraction from the bonus should be accurate enough.
If Bob Too's PSTR were to drop two points for whatever reason then it should suffice to subtract 10 from the type A BP, 4 from the B BP, and 2 from the type C BP.
If the attribute adjustments are only transient then the referee may omit the calculations to ensure playability.

=== Level Component BP
The BP is contingent on two factors: the persona's attributes and experience level.
These two factors are added to complete the BP for characters as they attain higher levels.
At first, low level personas will be dependent mostly on the persona's natural attributes and not on her experience level.
The BP will increase as the persona gains EXPS and increases her level.
There is no experience bonus at level one so this data is not included here.

Eventually, the to-hit bonus will be more dependent on the combat experience of the persona than the persona's attributes.
This is reflected in an increase of the bonus proficient for each new experience level that the persona advances.
The BPs increase incrementally every experience level regardless of the persona's class.
Combat classes have a much greater BP increase per level than the non-combat classes.

For each combat situation that the persona survives, she earns experience points.
EXPS can be earned for carrying out class skills and the combat classes receive more experience for combat than the other personas.
Each experience level represents a higher level of expertise in general combat.

== Bonus Non-Proficient (BNP)
The BNP is used for to-hit rolls when the persona is not proficient with a particular weapon.

Whether or not a persona is proficient in a particular weapon depends on the player.
The weapons that a persona is proficient in are chosen by the player and are recorded on the persona record sheet.
Proficiencies are related to specific weapons and not weapon types.
So a persona could be proficient with a bow but not with all type B weapons.
The BNP is the second of the four columns on the combat table.

When the persona is using a weapon that she is not familiar with, the player may only add the Bonus Non-Proficient (BNP) to her to hit roll.
The BNP is intimately linked to her BP and does increase her chance to be successful in combat.
However, the bonus non-proficient is much less than the bonus proficient and, in lethal personal combat, every edge increases the persona's chances of survival.

Calculating the BNP: The BNP is calculated separately for all three of the weapon types.
Each BNP is a fraction of the BP for the same weapon type.
The values listed on the Bonus Non-Proficient are percentages.
A spie's BNP for a type A weapon would be 25% of her BP for type A weapons.
This means that whenever the persona's BP changes, so does her BNP.
The percentages listed on the Bonus Non-Proficient Table are multiplied by the BP to create the BNP.
For example, if a first level nomad's BP for weapon Type A were 100, then her BNP would be 15 (100 times .15).
When making a roll to hit with a non-proficient Type B weapon, the player would add 15 to her hit roll instead of 100.
Personas will find themselves using proficient weapons as often as possible.

== Maximum Roll (MR)
The maximum roll is the third column of the combat table.
It is simultaneously the most important component and the most frustrating component of the tactical combat table.
The maximum roll is the highest to-hit roll that the player can make.
If her maximum roll is 894 then anything that she rolls on kilo-dice that is higher than 894 is announced as 894.
If her kilo-die roll is 987 plus a BP of 134, her final to hit roll is 894, not 1121.

//+++<figure id="attachment_1423" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1423" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[.size-medium.wp-image-1423] image::https://i0.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/maximumroll.151-300x248.png?resize=300%2C248[Some of us will never have the skill to hit the target.,300,link=https://i0.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/maximumroll.151.png]+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-1423" class="wp-caption-text">+++Some of us will never have the skill to hit the target.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

The MR is directly tied to the persona's BP and increases with experience levels.
Thus the higher the persona's level, the higher the maximum roll and the more that she is capable of scoring a hit on.
To calculate the persona's maximum roll, refer to the Maximum Roll Table.
The player adds her persona's bonus proficient to the base MR for each of the weapon types.
That is her persona's MR for that weapon type regardless of whether she is using her BP or BNP.

// insert table 138

Without the Maximum Roll (MR) the referee will find that low levels personas are could be just as successful in lethal personal combat as much higher level personas.
If there is no limiting difference between low and high level personas in combat then there is no point in having combat classes advance in experience levels.
Occasionally a persona will be unable to hit a particular target because its armour rating is too high.
This will leave some players feeling helpless and frustrated.
That would indicate that its time for their persona to run away.

The maximum roll also raises a problem of realism for the referee.
Should a persona know that she cannot hit a target?
Is it realistic for a persona to stop attacking a ferocious alien after just one failed attack?
The referee may deceive the players (for realism of course), by pretending that a maximum roll is a hit, recording the damage, but not subtracting it from the targets hit point total.
After a while the players will realize that the alien has withstood tremendous amounts of damage, but it is still being ferocious.
It is then a role-playing decision whether or not to continue the combat, or to enact a tactical withdrawal.

If a veterinarian persona has a BP of 95 for type A weapons, her maximum roll for type A weapons would be 720.
Any to hit roll that the player made for type A weapons could be no higher than 720.
The MR is calculated for all three weapon types and applies to any weapon in that category be it proficient, non-proficient, or skilled (only mercenaries have weapon skills).
If the same veterinarian's BP were to increase to 106, then her MR would increase to 731 and any to hit roll greater than 731 would be announced as 731.

== Damage Adjustment (DA)
Damage adjustments are made for any non-powered attack that the persona uses.
A stronger persona could generate more killing forces, more damage, than a weaker persona when using a weapon that depends on PSTR for damage.

The damage adjustment is the last column of the combat table.
The DA represents the effect of physical strength on non-powered weapons.
Damage adjustment only applies to type A and type B weapons.
There is no damage adjustment for type C weapons because these are powered weapons and the PSTR of the attacker does not affect the damage inflicted.

Type A weapons have a DA equal to the persona's PSTR.
Any persona attacking with a type A weapon can add a number of HPS in damage equal to their PSTR.
If a persona with an 11 PSTR were to hit with a long sword, she would add 6 HPS to her d8 damage roll.
Type B weapons are less dependent on PSTR and only add one-quarter of the persona's PSTR when they inflict damage.
If the same persona hit with a throwing dagger, she would increase her damage by 3 HPS.
Consult the Damage Adjustment table for more information.

Proficient means that the persona can use the design of a weapon so that it aids her in combat.
Proficiency is more similar to weapon familiarity than it is to weapon skill.
It allows the persona to hit with the edge of a sword, use the full leverage of a pike, and aim a gun in the right direction.
Each proficiency refers to a single weapon.
Thus a persona that can have 3 proficiencies can choose 3 specific weapons that she is proficient in.
If a persona is proficient in a weapon it means that her player can add her personas Bonus Proficient (BP) to any to hit rolls that she makes.
Proficiency does not increase the personas ability to score a hit by increasing her bonus proficient, but it allows the player to add her entire BP to any to hit rolls that she makes.
Combat based persona classes like nomads, spies, and knites get more proficiencies that non-combat classes like mechanics, biologists and nothings.

Personas are not automatically proficient in all weapon types, and they must choose them carefully.
For example, being proficient with a laser may be really fun until its batteries run out, and in the long run a crossbow proficiency may have been a better choice.
What weapons a persona is proficient in is completely determined by the player.
Weapon proficiencies need not be chosen all at the same time, and the player can wait until the right weapon for her persona comes along.
The number of weapons that a persona can be proficient in is limited, and is dependant on her class.
Combat classes start with more proficiencies and learn new ones faster, while non-combat class personas will become proficient in very few weapons.

=== Initial Proficiency
Each persona has an initial number of proficiencies when she starts at first level.
The number of proficiencies is determined Chapter 9: Combat Table.
Each proficiency represents familiarity with one particular weapon.
She does not have to choose all three of these proficiencies in first level, and in the case of type C weapons the persona may not even encounter them.



// isn't there a table for this

=== Acquiring Proficiencies
If the player chooses that her persona is proficient in a particular weapon then she simply records it on her persona record sheet.
The player may find that 3 non-powered weapons aren't enough proficiencies for her nomad, because she has encountered some additional weapon that she would love to be proficient in.
The player can add new proficiencies as her persona increases in experience levels.
If the nomad described earlier had used up all her proficiencies for type A and B weapons then she would have to wait until 3rd level before she can add another non-powered weapon proficiency.
The number of initial proficiencies, and the intervals that new ones are added are listed on the
