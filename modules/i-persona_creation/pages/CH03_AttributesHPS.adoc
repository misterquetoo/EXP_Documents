= Hit Points (HPS)

.How much physical damage can one endure?

Hit points reflect the persona’s ability to withstand physical damage.
The important components of HPS are based on the body construction.
how well the brain is protected; the amount of protective tissue around vital organs; and the connective tissue’s ability to resist tearing and shattering.
There are other less gruesome components of hit points.
These include the innate skill of the body, as a whole, to react to threat and just plain old luck.

Hit points are a very dynamic attribute.
Unlike the persona’s other attributes, which are unlikely to ever alter during a persona’s life, hit points will constantly have different values, although none of these values should exceed the persona’s maximum HPS.

Whenever a player character is injured in some way or other, she loses HPS.
Personas which lose too many hit points will die.
Personas which die from loss of hit points will usually die in some violent death.
shooting, stabbing car accident, fall, explosions, etc.
For more information about losing hit points, she chapters 26 or 27 in the combat section.

Personas don’t just lose hit points until they die (hit points are a dynamic attribute, not a declining attribute).
Personas can regain hit points back through rest.
See Chapter 13. Health for more information about rest.
Medical attention can also heal back lost hit points.

The hit point doesn’t convert to some unit of energy – like an erg.
However, the hit point is a constant value. \
Any anthro, alien or robot that absorbs 10 HPS of damage deducts that from their HPS total.
What varies is how each family type is affected upon reaching 1 HPS.
How aliens and robots respond to very low hit point totals (less than 1) is covered in their respective chapters.
How people respond to particular HPS totals is detailed here.

All in all, hit points are a general indicator of a being’s overall hardiness.
The more HPS the creature has, the better condition she is in.

== HPS Maximum
A persona’s maximum HPS is determined once, while the player is rolling her attributes.
The maximum HPS cannot be exceeded by healing of any sort (of course, there are always exceptions).
No pity should be given to the players while they are rolling their persona’s HPS.
Hit points should be considered just another attribute which will determine class and family.
Once the player has determined a maximum HPS, it should be recorded in ink on her persona record sheet.

=== Anthro Hit Points Calculation
.HPS = (1/2 CON x 1d8) + CON
****
A persona with a CON of 11 would roll 6d8 and add 11. Rounding benefits the player.
****


The persona’s CON attribute plays an important role in determining the persona’s maximum HPS.
A persona’s HPS is determined by rolling d8s.
A player may roll 1d8 for every two points of CON.
The total of these d8s comprises a large component of the HPS. The persona’s HPS are then adjusted by her CON attribute.
For every 1 point of CON the persona has, 1 hit point is added to the maximum HPS.

== HPS Minimum

The player must also be aware of several conditions that are tied into damage and HPS.
When a persona takes 1 and a ½ times her HPS max without any interim healing, she is permanently dead.
So the persona that rolled 26 HPS max would be dead if her HPS total dropped below -13; a persona with 54 HPS max would be dead if her HPS total were to go below -27 HPS; one with 44 HPS max would be dead if her HPS total were to drop below -22 HPS.
This is also called negative one half of one’s HPS.

=== Anthro Minimum HPS Calculation
.Death = -1 times (1/2 max HPS)
****
For example an anthro persona with 30 HPS would be dead if their HPS total to negative 15 (-15).
****

Hit points appear to be an attribute that can drop below 1 without killing the persona.
This is true; however, any persona with a negative hit point total is in a state of severe trauma – she is dying.
When negative (having a negative HPS total), a persona loses one hit point each 5 units (10 seconds) she is left unattended.
This rapid decline to death cannot be halted unless medically treated.
See Chapter 34: Healing for more information.

A persona with negative HPS total is completely unconscious and can do nothing other than lie about and bleed.
Things start to return to normal once the persona is returned to a positive HPS total; something which the body cannot do itself.

== Damage System Shock (DSS)
Personas with positive hit point totals still have to be cautious.
Whenever a persona loses more than half her present hit point total in one attack, she must make a DSS roll or be knocked unconscious.
A damage system shock roll (DSS) is a deci-die roll less than 3 times her current HPS total plus her Con.
If the player rolls higher than 3 x HPS + Con on percentile dice, the persona has been stunned or knocked down.


=== Calculate Damage System Shock (DSS)
.DSS = (3 times current HPS) + CON
****
Consider a persona with a 10 CON and 20 HPS. 
If she were to take 12 HPS at once a DSS roll would be required.
The persona now has a 10 CON and 8 HPS.
She would have to roll 34 or less on 1d100 to keep standing.
****

== Recovery Rolls (REC)
The stunned persona will remain inactive until she makes a successful recovery roll.
A recovery roll (REC) is a percentile dice roll less than 5 times her persona’s HPS total plus her Con.
If the player rolls higher than her 5 x HPS + Con on deci-dice, the persona remains stunned or knocked down.
The player may only attempt a recovery roll as often as her Con dictates.


=== Calculate Recovery Rolls (REC)
.REC = (5 times current HPS) + CON
****
Consider a persona with a 10 CON and 8 HPS. 
If she were stunned she could make a recovery roll (REC).
She would have to roll less than 50 on 1d100 to get back up.

An example using numbers may help.
Two player characters both take equal damage in a car accident, let’s say 20 HPS.
However, each persona has a different HPS total.
Persona Sea has 43 HPS and a 15 Con and player Ecks has 34 HPS and an 11 Con.
Persona Sea can unstrap her seat belt and stagger away but persona Ecks must make a DSS roll or be knocked unconscious.
This is because persona Ecks took more than half her HPS total at once but persona Sea did not.
Ecks has 14 HPS left and, therefore, must roll less than 42 on deci-dice or be knocked unconscious.
Since the player running persona Ecks rolled 54 on the percentile dice, her character is stunned for 10 units (duration) until she can attempt a recovery roll.
Ten units later (about 20 game seconds), the player must roll less than 90 on the percentile dice or remain stunned for another 10 units.

Note that units are a very precise measure of game time that are only relevant during combat.
Once combat has ended, all stunned personas should immediately recover and be able to join in on the game.
