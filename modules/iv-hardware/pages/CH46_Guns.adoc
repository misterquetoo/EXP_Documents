= Guns

Guns are weapons designed for lethal personal combat.
They are designed to destroy targets with whatever means is available.
Guns are included in the technology book because combat is, unfortunately, an unavoidable aspect of most exploration.
If our planet earth is any indication of how dangerous the universe is, then weaponry of some sort will always be present.
If the unintelligent wildlife doesn't pose a threat to the expedition, then malicious intelligent life forms will, and if there is no threat to the expedition, then its members will often fight amongst themselves.
It's not that the personas are so violent, it's just that is what we can expect from the players ourselves.

Getting back on track, the persona's will want weaponry to fight their battles.
The most popular form of personal weaponry is the gun, and guns are covered in detail here.
This chapter includes a host of weapons from all manner of popular entertainment.

The gun is rolled on Table 46.2: Gun Type, and the necessary information for role-playing is recorded by the referee.
Don't be daunted by the apparent volume of information to be recorded.
The essentials are damage, and ammo capacity.
All other information is for combat connoisseurs of varying degrees.
For instance, referees using the theatrical combat system need only record the rate of fire, and the damage for a successful hit.
However referees using the tactical combat system may need to know the range and decay of the weapon being used.
Only use the amount of information that ensures play remains fun!

== Type 

Type refers to the weapon type that the gun falls into.
The separation of these weapon types is detailed in http://expgame.com/?page_id=300[Chapter 28: Weapons].
A type C weapon can make one attack per unit.
This means one to hit roll every 2 seconds.
The delay between attacks is due to items like weapon recharge, weapon re-stabilization, re-aiming, or recalibration.

When using the combat table, as in tactical combat, all weapons in this chapter attack as weapon type C.
This is the classification for powered weapons.
All guns attack as weapon type C regardless of whether their type is listed as type D, type E, type F, or Flotto.

=== Attack Types 
Guns that recharge faster, are better stabilized, or are easier to aim can fire more often.
For example, type D attacks twice per unit, type E attacks three times each unit, and type F attacks four times a unit.
Often a gun will have several types listed like C, D, F.
This means that the persona can set the weapon to make various numbers of attacks each unit.
This is usually adjusted by trigger squeeze, or some switch setting on the weapon.
Each attack requires a to hit roll.

=== Flotto 
Flotto is a full auto feature where the weapon releases at least 15 rounds in less than 2 seconds.
This full auto burst yields 5 to hit rolls, where the persona can aim at any five contiguous targets in her forward field of vision.
A hit will score 0 to 3 bullets on the target.
Each bullet that hits the target will inflict the damage listed for the gun.
If a gun that inflicts 2-12 HPS of damage, hit with a full auto burst for 2 bullets, the attacker would roll 2d6 twice for damage.
The full auto is a very lethal attack.
However, as the rapid fire mode continues, the gun becomes more and more difficult to control, and a cumulative to hit roll penalty of -30 is added for each successive to hit roll.

The flotto attack can bog down combat for inexperienced players.
The first thing to do if combat is getting slow is to remove the -30 per to hit roll penalty.
If this doesn't work then replace the 5 to hit rolls with a single to hit roll on one target, that inflicts 1 to 11 bullets of damage if it hits.
Deadly, but simple.

== Range 
The range is the effective range of the weapon itself.
This does not reflect the skills of the persona in anyway.
The weapon's range is limited by wavering bullets, dissipating charges, or decaying material.
If the range is listed as 120 hex, (-230): the gun has no to hit penalties up to 120 hexes, and then a penalty of -230 to hit per hex beyond that range.
This gun would have -230 to hit a target 121 hexes away.
Some weapons even have -1000 for any hexes beyond their range, this means that the attack literally stops at that distance.
Theatrical combat has no range penalties, and any range effects are optional.

== Accuracy 
Accuracy very simply reflects the accuracy of the gun.
The better balanced, and better designed, the weapon, the easier it is to hit the target.
The accuracy attribute of a gun is simply added to the to hit roll.

== Damage 
The damage is the range of hit points that can be removed from a target when the gun scores a hit.
The more hit points removed, the more damage the gun inflicts.
The guns are given a range of damage that is randomly generated each time a successful hit is made.
This randomness accounts for all the unpredictability that is involved in tissue damage and projectile physics.
This damage range is all the damage that the gun can inflict;
type C weapons get no damage adjustment.
When using the combat table all powered weapons whether type C, D, E,+++<b>++++++</b>+++F, or Special attack as type C weapons

*Special*: If the gun's damage is listed as "Special", then the nature of the damage is discussed in the gun description, and it is usually complex or has some special effect (vaporization, death, etc.).

*Calibre*: If there is a list of damages like 2-24, 2-20, 3-18, 2-16, and 1-15, then this gun has models with various calibres, or power levels.
The middle damage range (in this case 3-18) is the medium calibre attack and is the standard damage of the weapon type.
A gun with calibres will only have one damage type.
For example, the first damage range on the list inflicts the most damage, 2-24, it is the highest calibre (power level), and is called an extra high powered weapon.
The list goes as follows: XHP, HP, MP, LP, and XLP.
See Table 46.1: Gun Calibre if the referee chooses to randomly determine calibre.

// insert table 529

== Magazine 

The magazine of a gun is the maximum ammo amount that can be found in the cartridge, or the maximum number of attacks per battery set.
When this number of attacks is exhausted, the persona must reload.
A gun with an ammo listing of 45 could fire 45 rounds before the persona would have to reload.
Referees should note that artifact guns are rarely found fully loaded.

== Malfunction 

The malfunction stat is the kilodie chance that the weapon has lost its attack for one reason or another.
If the weapon has a malfunction stat of 30, any to hit roll less than 30 would indicate a weapon malfunction.
The lost attack may be due to a dud shell, a battery mischarge, or a mechanism jam.
Some malfunctions have lethal effects for those standing nearby the weapon.
The malfunction is checked against the persona's unadjusted kilodie roll.
The referee should check any unadjusted kilodie roll less than 40.

== Wate 

The wate is simply the unloaded wate of the gun in kilograms.
The wate of a gun can be reduced, or increased, depending on the tech level of the device.
If a list of three wates is given (4.62, 2.75, 1.95), then they refer to the different wates of caliber weapons.
XHP, and HP use the leftmost value (4.62), MP uses the middle value (2.75), and LP, and XLP use the rightmost value (1.95).

The wate of ammunition is included in brackets beside the gun wate.
If there is no value listed to the right of the gun wate, then the gun uses batteries, and the battery wate is added instead.
A set wate, like 20 gm, gives the wate of a complete cartridge.
A percentage value indicates that the wate of the ammo is a fraction of the wate of the entire gun.
For example, if a 2.5 kg gun had ammo listed as 1% then one of its shells would have a wate of 25 gm.
As a ref, I ignore ammo wate completely.
The information is included for the purists, or for when enormous amounts of ammo are being handled.
Remember only keep the data that makes the game more fun.

== EXPS 

This is the amount of experience points awarded to the firer of the gun, or whoever else, identifies the gun's nature.

== Value 

This is the value of the gun, if it should ever be sold, or appraised.
There is no guarantee that a gun will be sold for its correct worth.
The value given that is in brackets indicates the value of the ammo, "b"
means that the ammo is actually a battery charge.+++<figure id="attachment_5322" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5322" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i0.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/guns_labelled-300x201.png?resize=300%2C201[Obvious guns.,300]](https://i2.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/guns_labelled.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5322" class="wp-caption-text">+++Obvious guns.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== Gun Type 

Determine the artifact gun type by rolling on Table 46.2: Gun Type.

// insert table 530

== 1) Aerosol Pistol 

// insert table 528

An aerosol pistol amplifies some of the abilities of targetable aerosols.
This pistol will double the targetable range, and triple the number of charges of an ordinary aerosol canister.
In no way does this pistol alter area of effect, duration, or damage of an aerosol.
Aerosol canisters cannot be disconnected from the pistol until all charges are extinguished.
If an aerosol that has a range of 10 hexes and an area of effect of 3 hexes were to be inserted into this pistol, the aerosol would then have a range of 20 hexes, the same area of effect, and it could be ejected from the pistol 3 times.

A malfunction indicates a loss of all remaining charges.
There is a slim chance (determined by the ref) of the weapon exploding on malfunction.

== 2) Aerosol Rifle 

// insert table 531

An aerosol rifle enhances two of the abilities of targetable aerosols.
This rifle will triple the targetable range, and quintuple (five times) the number of charges in an aerosol canister.
In no way can this device alter the area of effect, duration or damage of any aerosol.
Aerosol canisters cannot be disconnected from an aerosol rifle until all charges are deployed.
If an aerosol that has a range of 10 hexes and an area of effect of 3 hexes were to be inserted into this pistol, the aerosol would then have a range of 30 hexes, the same area of effect, and it could be ejected from the rifle 5 times.
A malfunction will indicate a loss of all remaining charges.
There is a slim chance, determined by the ref, that the weapon will explode on a malfunction.

== 3) Antimat Pistol 

// insert table 532

An antimat pistol launches a micro particle of antimatter suspended in a lattice of electrons.
This lattice will shatter when it hits a liquid or solid.
The resulting explosion will instantly annihilate 50 kg of matter.
The explosion releases a blast of heavy particles and super-heated gases that will affect everything within a ten hex radius regardless of cover.
Everything in the ten hex radius will take 25 to 70 (5d10+20) hit points of damage.
A malfunction with this weapon means the electron lattice has shattered within the gun.
This usually means a harmless misfire, but if the ref is in a bad mood the gun will disintegrate itself.

== 4) Antimat Rifle 

// insert table 533

An antimat rifle is the long range cousin of the antimat pistol.
The antimat rifle releases a larger particle of antimatter, and causes a more powerful explosion.
The antimat rifle attack eliminates approximately 200 kilograms of matter.
The resulting blast has a 25 hex radius inflicting 35 to 80 (5d10+30) hit points of damage.
In other respects, the antimat rifle functions the same as an antimat pistol.
More information is listed under gun 3, Antimat pistol.

== 5) Beegun 

// insert table 534

The beegun's activation chamber excites a normally docile insect into a poisonous rage.
After two units of warming up, the beegun is ready to fire as a normal weapon.
If this weapon scores a hit, the insect will inject a deadly and instantaneous poison.
The hit victim must save vs.
intensity 19 to 24 (18+d6) poison, or die.
If the target does save she will be comatose for 1-4 days.
The ammunition for a beegun is not reusable.
A malfunction can only occur in the ammo of this weapon.
If a malfunction occurs, a hit will inflict 1 to 10 hit points of damage, but it will not be poisonous.

== 6) Bolt Action rifle

// insert table 535

This is your normal hunting, or target, rifle.
This weapon can also be called a pump action, revolving chamber, steam, or pneumo-rifle.
The medium powered bolt action rifle damage is 3-30 and its wate is 3.4kg, The other listed damages and wates are for higher and lower calibers of this gun type.
A malfunction with this weapon is a misfire, and not a jam.

== 7) Cryogun 

// insert table 536

A cryogun subjects everything along its path to extreme cold.
Every target along the two by fifteen hex path will take damage.
The damage generated is equivalent to the percentage chance of an object being trapped or frozen along the path.
If 15 hit points of damage is rolled, there would be a 15% chance of trapping a medium, or smaller, sized object in ice.
There would also be a 15% chance of freezing swords in scabbards, buttons in the on position, steering wheels straight ahead, etc.

The chance of freezing must be checked for each object.
The freezing effects of a cryogun will melt away in 6 to 60 units.
Heating will halve the melting time.
Trapped targets that win a bizarre (kilo die) PSTR http://expgame.com/?page_id=275attribute-rolls[attribute ]http://expgame.com/?page_id=275attribute-rolls[roll] can break free of the ice.
This weapon is also known as a Frigid Aire, or a cop gun (they don't have to yell "freeze"
they just pull the trigger).
A malfunction results in the loss of a charge.

== 8) Death Ray 

// insert table 1057

The death ray pistol attacks the electrochemical life force of organic creatures.
The beam attack must score a hit to be effective.
Any organic creature hit by a death ray pistol must http://expgame.com/?page_id=275saving-throw[save vs.]http://expgame.com/?page_id=275saving-throw[poison] or die.
The intensity of the attack (3-24) is generated every time the weapon is fired.
This weapon is also called a kill-o-zap gun or a terminator.
The malfunction of this weapon will occasionally call for an attack on the firer.
Normal malfunctions result in the loss of all remaining charges.

== 9) Derringer 

// insert table 1057

The derringer is a small compact and concealable weapon.
It is composed mostly of plastic alloys, and is coated with finger print resistant materials.
The derringer can be melted to nothing in less than 5 units by submerging it in boiling water . When being concealed this weapon will give bonuses of +20 on sneaky PT rolls.
This weapon is also known as a family planner, or a Saturday night special.
A malfunction will jettison dud ammo and count as a misfire.

== 10) Disintegration Gun 

// insert table 538

The disintegration gun is a very temperamental weapon.
It is capable of boiling away large amounts of any liquid or solid that it hits.
The firer must first score a hit, and then after that no one is sure how much material will be destroyed.
The disintegration rifle could boil away 1-100 (a deci-die) kilograms of matter, this amount must be rolled after every hit.
The more matter to be disintegrated, the less likely the event will occur.
There is a 1% chance per kg of destroyed matter that the attack will fail.

Partial vaporizations, those hits where only a portion of the target is disintegrated, will inflict 1-20 (1d20) HPS of damage per kilogram of material vaporized.
Vaporization has no effect on adjacent objects other than surrounding them in a colourful haze of gas.
A failed vaporization will inflict a hefty 8-64  (8d8) HPS of damage.

If an attack were supposed to disintegrate 27 kilograms of matter then there would be a 27% chance that the attack would fail.
If the attack did fail, the target would take 8d8 hit points in damage.
If the attack did not fail then the target would either disappear completely (if its wate were less than 27 kg), or it would take 27d20 hit points in damage.+++<figure id="attachment_9853" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9853" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i2.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pyrotomic_disintegrator_pistol-300x165.png?resize=300%2C165[Patent 168972 G.C.

Pistol version.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

The disintegrated matter must be semi-contiguous, e.g.
a hit on the backpack, would annihilate the backpack, and send its unharmed contents clattering to the floor.
If the target has been missed, but there is a chance that some piece of equipment has been disintegrated, it may be necessary to refer to the hit location tables in http://expgame.com/?page_id=316[Chapter 36: Hit Location].
To determine if items are contiguous can be done by rolling http://expgame.com/?page_id=275sphincter-dice[sphincter dice].
Very rarely will a malfunction of this weapon result in its vaporization.
This gun is also known as a vaporizer.+++<figure id="attachment_10164" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10164" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i1.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tom_corbett_pistol-300x197.png?resize=300%2C197[patent 169440 M.

== 11) Electron Pistol 

// insert table 539

The electron pistol unleashes a blast of electrons which damage the bonding ability of molecules.
An attack from an electron pistol can pass through a force field unaffected.
In fact, the attack of an electron pistol will damage a force field and continue on with its attack to damage the target.
An electron pistol is also called a penetrater, or the chickenz surprise.
The medium powered electron pistol damage is 3-30 and its wate is 1 kg, The other listed damages and wates are for higher and lower calibers of this gun type.
A malfunction results in the loss of a charge.

The medium powered electron rifle damage is 4-40 and its wate is 4.0kg, The other listed damages and wates are for higher and lower calibers of this gun type.
A malfunction results in the loss of a charge.

== 13) Fission Pistol 

// insert table 541

The fission pistol uses an energy wave to superheat hydrogen molecules in its path.
Obviously this weapon can only be used in hydrogen laden atmospheres (air and water are good examples).
Charges are still drained if the weapon is fired in the absence of hydrogen.
This is one of the few devices that will certainly be waterproofed.
Some cynics call this weapon a kettlegun.
Occasionally malfunctions will indicate a backflash, resulting in damage to the firer.

The medium powered full auto rifle damage is 3-30 and its wate is 3.6kg, The other listed damages and wates are for higher and lower calibers of this gun type.


== 19) Fusion Pistol 

// insert table 546

The fusion pistol is an absolutely vicious weapon.
When fired, it releases a micro blob of fusion material.
The firer of this weapon will take 3-30 hit points of damage from a fusion backflash.
This damage will be inflicted every time the weapon is fired, unless the firer is wearing http://expgame.com/?page_id=3111[powered armour].
The fusion pistol has built in shielding that will protect the firer, while absorbing some of the gun's charges.
When the fusion pistol's shielding is being used, the pistol only has three charges.
The status of the shielding is determined when the batteries are inserted.

The pistol itself inflicts substantial damage to targets in two ways.
The first is getting caught in the fusion blob's path.
This does not mean that the persona has been hit by the superheated blob, but that it passed near her.
The second method is getting hit with the fusion blob proper.
For this to happen a successful to hit roll must be made.
No to hit roll is required to get caught in a fusion blob's path, and as long as the attack passes near the target she will take damage.

All personas and equipment (including the target) along the trajectory of the fusion blob will take 6 to 60 (6d10) hit points in damage.
This swath of heat damage affects anything within a one hex radius along the fusion blob's path.
This path of this damage is two hexes wide.
The fusion blob inflicts additional damage on the target if a hit is scored.
The amount of damage depends on the target's size.
See Table 46.3, Fusion Pistol Effects to determine how much damage the targets take.

// insert table 547

Using the Fusion Pistol Effects Table it can be determined that a hit on a medium sized target would inflict 14 to 140 (14d10) hit points of damage.
First 6 to 60 hit points from the heat of the approaching blob, and then 8 to 80 hit points from the blob itself.

If the target is tiny or small sized it will explode if it is hit with a fusion attack.
Anything within one hex radius of an exploding target will take collateral damage from molten shrapnel and boiling goo.
This means that anything standing along the fusion blob's path, and within one hex of an exploding target (tiny or small sized) will take both swath damage and collateral damage.
It should be immediately obvious that this weapon has not been designed for close quarters combat.
This weapon has been nicknamed GVMB (grossly vicious meat burner), party killer, or the BFG.
A malfunction will result in an explosion inflicting 6 to 60 hit points of damage to everything within a 3 hex radius.

== 20) Fusion Rifle 

// insert table 548

A fusion rifle is the big cousin of the fusion pistol,  and it is an more vicious and disgusting weapon.
When fired, it releases a micro blob of fusion material.
The firer of this weapon, and all within 1 hex will take 6 to 60 (6D10) HPS of damage from a fusion backflash.
This damage will be inflicted every time the weapon is fired, unless the firer is wearing http://expgame.com/?page_id=3111[powered armour].
The fusion rifle has built in shielding that will prevent the backflash, while absorbing some of the charges.
When the fusion rifle's shielding is being used, the rifle only has three charges.
The status of the shielding is determined when the batteries are inserted.

The rifle itself inflicts substantial damage to targets in three manners.
The first is getting caught in the fusion blob's swath damage.
This does not mean that the target has been hit by the blob, but that it passed near her.
The second method is getting hit with the fusion blob proper.
For this to happen a successful to hit roll must be made.
No to hit roll is required to get caught in a fusion blob's path, as long as the target is standing within the swath's area of effect.
The third method is to get caught within the area of effect of an exploding target (collateral damage).

All personas and equipment (including the target) along the trajectory of the fusion blob will take 8 to 80 (8d10) HPS of damage.
This swath of heat damage affects anything along the fusion blob's swath, which is 3 hexes wide.
This fusion blob inflicts additional damage to the target if a hit is scored.
The amount of damage inflicted depends on the target's size.
See Table 46.4: Fusion Rifle Effects to determine how much damage the target's take.

// insert table 549

Using the Fusion Rifle Effects Table it can be determined that a hit on a large sized target would inflict 18 to 180 (18d10) hit points of damage.
First 8 to 80 hit points from the heat of the approaching blob, and then 10 to 100 hit points from the blob itself.

If the target is tiny, small, or medium sized it will explode if it is hit with a fusion rifle attack.
Anything within three hexes of an exploding target will take 8 to 80 hit points of damage from molten shrapnel and boiling goo.
This means that anything standing along the fusion blob's path, and within one hex of an exploding target (tiny or small sized) will take 16 to 160 hit points of damage.

It should be immediately obvious that this weapon has not been designed for close quarters combat.
This weapon has been nicknamed GVMB (grossly vicious meat burner), the party killer or the BFG.
A malfunction will result in an explosion inflicting 8 to 80 hit points of damage to everything within a 5 hex radius.

== 21) Gauss Pistol 

// insert table 550

The gauss pistol magnetically hurls special ammunition.
Each round has a sufficient electrostatic charge to power the firing mechanism.
The magnetic force stored within the rounds cannot be harnessed for any other procedure, unless a DD20 maneuver is completed by a mechanic.
Magnetic attacks do affect this weapon.
It must be noted that this weapon is not silent.
The medium powered gauss pistol damage is 3-30 (3d10) and its wate is 1.5kg, The other listed damages and wates are for higher and lower calibers of this gun type.
A malfunction indicates a mechanism jam (very, very rare).


== 22) Gauss Rifle 

// insert table 551

With the above alterations noted, the gauss rifle is the same as gun 21, gauss pistol.
It is not silent and enjoys a to hit bonus due to it's minimal kick back.
The medium powered gauss rifle damage is 4-48 (4d12) and its wate is 3.5kg, The other listed damages and wates are for higher and lower calibers of this gun type.
A malfunction indicates a mechanism jam (very, very rare).


== 23) Glass Gun 

// insert table 552

The glass gun sprays clouds of minute ceramic shards.
This weapon enjoys a +200 accuracy bonus on to hit rolls against multi-pieced armour.
Some examples of mulit-pieced armour are furs, leather, padded, studded, ring, scale and chain.
This includes unarmoured targets or most alien hides.
This weapon does not get its accuracy bonus when it is being used against full piece armour: robots, powered armour, full plate armour, and vac suits.
Each cartridge has its own power source.
This power source can only be accessed by the glass gun, unless a mechanic succeeds at a 20 DD maneuver.
A malfunction indicates a mechanism jam.

== 24) Grapple Gun 

// insert table 553

The grapple gun fires a cord that is attached to a very sticky blob (appearing as a bunch of grapes), or a vicious metal barb.
The sticky thing does no damage, but it will attach to anything that it hits.
The pointed barb will inflict 4 to 24 (4d6)  HPS of damage, and has a 5% chance per hit point of damage of sticking.
The grapple gun will have the vicious barbed format 60% of the time.
The grapple gun has a built in winch that can pull 130 kg at up to 3 h/u.
A grapple that is unattached can be rewound at a speed of 6 h/u.
Unless a grapple is under tension it can easily be removed.
Removing a pointed barb grapple will inflict a 1d4 hit points in damage.
A malfunction with this weapon indicates a mechanism jam.

== 25) Gravruptor Gun 

// insert table 554

This gun causes bizarre gravitational anomalies on those targets that it hits.
Any target that is hit by the weapon will be subject to a blast of random gravity.
The target gets no chance to negate the attack if the to hit roll is successful.
If the target's wate is more than 500 kg it is unaffected by this attack.
A hit with this weapon surrounds the target with a random 1-4 gravities.
This unpredictable dose of acceleration will throw the target in a random direction.
Targets will take 1 to 12 (1d12) HPS in damage per gravity regardless of whether they hit a ceiling, wall, fall to the ground, or are flung off into space.
This gravruptor gun can inflict from 1-48 HPS of damage per hit.
There are additional effects on a hit target and these depend on the atmospheric gravity around the target.

The lower the gravity the greater the effect that the gravruptor gun has on its target.
The range effects are doubled in 1/2 gravity situations and quadrupled in 1/4 gravity situations.
For instance a target would be knocked back 1 hex per 3 hit points of damage in 1/2 gravity.
The gravruptor gun is designed for zero gravity combat.
It has no recoil to cause the firer any spin problems, and sends those targets that it hits flying off into space.
A successful to hit roll will still inflict damage for accelerating the target, and the target will then fly away at 1 h/u per 2 hit points of damage.
Thus a hit that inflicts 20 hit points of damage would send the target racing off into space at an uncontrolled movement rate of 10 h/u.
The gravruptor gun is also known as an accelerator rifle, or a gravgun.
A malfunction with this weapon will result in a gravitational anomaly in the firing hex.

== 26) Job Pistol 

// insert table 556

The "Jack of all bullets"
(hence JOB) pistol is capable of propelling almost any solid material as a projectile attack.
The job pistol employs a combination gauss, spring and vacuum chamber mechanism.
To inflict damage this gun must be loaded with between 400 and 600 grams of materials.
This random garbage (sand, rocks, plastic, batteries, or bullets) will do 1-20 hit points of damage if a hit is scored.
One battery set can hurl about 5 kg of junk (this is about 10 shots).

This weapon is not a grenade launcher.
Grenade launchers arm, and fire, a grenade.
Pre-arming and then firing grenades inside a job pistol can result in accidental detonation.
A malfunction with this weapon indicates that garbage is jammed in the firing mechanism.

== 27) Job Rifle 

// insert table 557

== 31) Needler 

// insert table 561

A needier is a silent gauss pistol that launches bunches of very sharp needles at high velocities.
The needles can be coated in a variety of quick release poisons.
If a hit is scored, a save versus poison must be made by the target, or the poison will have its effect.
The poisons will only have an effect on organic targets.
The poison effect is determined on Table 46.6: Needler Effect.
The needier is the weapon most often used used by peace officers.

The effect of a needier attack is instantaneous, and the effect of each attack is complete incapacitation.
The poison effect will last for 1 to 4 minutes.
If the target saves versus poison there will be no effect.
The poison intensity must be rolled for every hit, this reflects the complexities of long range injections.

Wounds from this weapon appear as a gory mush.
Medical attention must be accompanied with a cauterizing ray (medical equipment 27), or a blood congealater (medical equipment 12), otherwise the veterinarian will suffer a +5DD penalty.

This weapon is specifically designed to be an anti-organic weapon.
Inorganic objects (robots, walls, machines, Argellian rock women) are unaffected by the attack since the disrupting ray passes through them unimpeded.
Walls, machines or robots that have organic components can be affected by this attack.
Inorganic armours have no effect on the attack of a protein disrupter so the target's AR, is essentially 500.
Note that the firer must still generate a to hit roll to ensure that a hit was made, and to check for a weapon malfunction.
Malfunction with a protein disrupter will inflict 1 to 10 hit points to anything organic in the firing hex.
