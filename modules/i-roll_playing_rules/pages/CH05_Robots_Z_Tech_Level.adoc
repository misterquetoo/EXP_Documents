= Robot Tech Level
This roll can adjust the wate and value of the robot.
A strange tech level could possibly make it more difficult to adapt a robot.
The tech level roll can make a robot lighter but it cannot make it any heavier.
If no tech level is rolled, the robot is assumed to have a tech level of 10.
