= Robot Adaptability
Only Mechanics can fit peripheral devices onto bots and this is done using the _Mechanics`' Performance Tables_.
The ADAPTABILITY is the percentage added to the Mechanic's PT roll, thus increasing the mechanic's chance for success.
The Degree of Difficulty of the particular procedure is determined by the ref.
Those bots with no adaptability percentage are designed to not be tampered with and instead of a PT roll bonus, the Mechanic suffers a 3 DD penalty.
