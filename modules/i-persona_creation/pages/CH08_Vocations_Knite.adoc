Knites are interesting hybrids of the mystical and the military.
They are more likely to draw on their mental strength than their physical strength.
Knites are cerebral warriors that are as likely to overpower someone with their will as with raw force.
They have no adverse disposition towards using technological weapons but knites feel most comfortable wielding their trademark energy sword.

Most referees will want to create their own mythos around such a powerful class but a few standard guidelines are laid down here.

*Mythos of the Knite*: The class is divided into two separate sects that are as different as dark and light.
Members of the sect which support compassion, goodwill, honesty, and humanity are referred to as Knites.
Knites are essentially good and will battle against injustice, intolerance, and enslavement of every possible opportunity.
Members of the opposite sect are called Anti-knites.
They are anti-everything.
Anti-knites are the destined enemies of goodwill, humanity, and organized civilizations.
They are not interested in the long-term collection of power per se but with the spreading of chaos.
Although their goal and purpose is the destruction of organization and the proliferation of entropy, this is not necessarily reflected in their personality.
For instance, a very calculated and extravagant plan may be the best way for an Anti-knite to topple a benevolent government.
Anti-knites are not played as malicious, off-the-wall anarchists but as extraordinarily systematic, ruthless, and calculating nihilists.

It is not uncommon for Knites (good sect) to go off on "`damn fool quests`".
On the other hand, Anti-knites will not answer to anyone less powerful than themselves.
All players in the expedition should realize that either sect can hinder the group's objectives.
Knites cannot look away and ignore injustices carried out by other personas and Anti-knites would be expected to systematically murder any persona which hinders their personal objectives.
Some form of combat is the only possible outcome of a Knite/Anti-knite encounter.

Some Knites from popular fiction are Yoda, Luke, Darth, Obi, and Lea (Star Wars), Poul Anderson's warriors (Kirlian Quest), and Paul Atreides (Dune).

*Class Requirements*: As you may have already determined, the knite class is a complex and powerful class to run.
It is very difficult for a persona to become a knite and the class is very rare.
Not only must the persona have the required attributes but she must also survive a trial period of an undetermined length of time.
Any persona who has the requisite attributes may announce her desire to pursue knitehood.
This intent may be secretly communicated to the referee or announced to the entire expedition.

Before a persona can become a knite, she must survive one experience level in a trial class.
The trial class may only be one of the following: mercenary, nomad or nothing.
This trial period is one of the requirements that make the knite class so radically different from other classes.
It is the persona's actions during this trial period that determines whether she will become a Knite or an Anti-knite.
Once potential knites have completed this level, they may be approached by a knite from either sect trying to enlist them.

Regardless of how much experience the persona attains during the trial level, upon becoming a knite, it is all lost.
The persona will always begin knitehood as a first level knite (with no experience) and preceding that she may never progress beyond first level in her trial class.

Practising knites do not have to be present for a player to be initiated.
Independently carrying out a particularly despicable or gallant act may be sufficient to ascend the persona to knitehood.
Slaughtering an unsuspecting expedition member or killing a knite is usually good (bad) enough to become an Anti-knite.
Attempting to rescue other personas, even evil ones, at extreme personal risk may be sufficient to become a knite.
Often, if the persona has acted accordingly during her trial period, she will be accepted into knitehood without her knowledge.
Thus a persona may be a knite without even knowing it.
This can lead ascendant knites to be constantly testing their potential knite abilities.
The consequences of this peculiar behaviour can often be nothing less than hilarious.

*Class Conduct*:  If members of either sect fail to act according to their doctrine, they will initially fail to collect experience, suffering the same experience penalties that other classes would.
If the transgression is particularly bad or just plain persistent, the knite may be expunged from the class.
Any knite to whom this happens will lose all her abilities and revert to first level of their trial class, losing all experience in the process.
If a player feels that they are in danger of losing control of their persona and are about to commit some act that may cost them their knitehood, they may voluntarily withdraw.
Any persona that voluntarily withdraws from being a knite will revert to their trial class but will not lose any experience points.

Usually knites that are having problems functioning within the strict guidelines of their class will meet with other problems long before they have the opportunity to withdraw.
Anti-knites are always prowling around in the dark waiting for knites to falter.
If a knite is having problems being good, it is almost certain that an anti-knite will have a cunning plan waiting to trick the knite over to the dark sect.
Consequences for anti-knites are much more severe.
If they begin to falter, they will almost certainly be exterminated in the ruthless plans of other anti-knites or even their own underlings.

A knite must also keep her attributes up in order to maintain the persona class.
In other classes, the dropping of essential attributes will only affect their performance in the class and will not result in their ejection from the class.
If a knite's MSTR should drop below 18 for any reason, she will cease to be a knite while her MSTR is decreased.
During this time, she will function as a persona in her trial class.
If the status of 18 MSTR is recovered, the knite will continue to function as a knite.

*Switching Sects*:  Voluntarily switching from one sect to another is a one-way street.
The switch for knites is made easily enough;
they can either say "`yes`" or they can fall for some cunning trick devised by the forces of darkness.
Knites (good sect) can become anti-knites through either route mentioned.
Anti-knites can only become knites if they elect to do so on their deathbed;
thus an anti-knite persona will never get the opportunity to be a knite.
The anti-knite's only other option is to withdraw from the class, resulting in the same complications described earlier.

Once a psionically aware persona is caught up in the kirlian mystery, it is difficult for them to completely escape the effects of knitehood and will find they will often be approached by other knites for indoctrination or other purpose.

Any persona that dies while in the knite class cannot be revived;
she is irretrievably dead to any form of technological or biological method of restoration.
Dead knites are required as ethereal, immaterial entities which will occasionally aid the ever-endangered forces of good.
Anti-knites have an irrevocable and eternal date with hell.

*Knite Abilities*:  The basis of the knites`' powers are psionic manipulations of the kirlian auras that surround all objects in the EXP universe.
Kirlian auras are not described in too much detail here because the referee may wish to base knites`' powers on some other type of universal, undetectable force.
The kirlian auras are bio-luminescent fields that when read by knites, can yield essential information about the object or creature that it surrounds.
The kirlian auras of sentient beings are constantly changing depending on their mood, intent, and general outlook on life.
The more powerful a knite, the better they can interpret the auras and the better they can manipulate them.

All of a knite's skills are present at first level but their degree of clarity and refinement (which determines their chance of success), depends on the experience level of the persona.
Although a knite may attempt to use any ability at any time, the chance for success depends on the knite's level and the difficulty of the kirlian ability.

The player must successfully roll on the Knite Performance Table before her knite is able to manipulate the kirlian auras.
Knites (generic) should be present to do their work.
Kirlian auras are almost useless to a knite once they have been photographed, recorded, or transmitted.

*Kirlian Sight (Automatic)*: The glowing, flickering kirlian auras allow the knite to maneuver easily in darkness.
They can "`see`" in the dark.
This night sight has a range of 1 hex per point of MSTR plus one additional hex per experience level.
Knites (generic) can use their kirlian sight to detect hidden objects more easily.
When searching with their kirlian sight, knites can use their MSTR instead of their AWE to try and find hidden objects.
This is because different types of wood or layers of paint show up clearly to the kirlian detecting knite.

*Mimic (d4 DD)*: A knite can perfectly reproduce a sound so well that it will even carry the emotional aspects it carried.
The sound must be repeated immediately upon being heard and whether the knite is successful in doing this, depends on her PT roll.
A second successful PT roll will allow her to permanently memorize the sound.
Before the recorded sound can be correctly reproduced after memorization, the knite must make another PT roll.
Mimicked sounds can have any effect except physical damage.

*Induce Silence (d4 DD)*: A successful PT roll will create an area of silence within the knite's own hex.
To continue the induced silence, a PT roll must be made every five units.
Sound cannot exit or enter the area of induced silence.
It should be harder for the knite to induce silence as the volume of the hidden sound increases.
This means that the knite can operate in silence but it also means that she cannot hear any sounds that are produced outside of her hex.

*False Rest (d4 DD)*: A successful PT roll will allow the knite to see with her eyes closed.
The images appear as hazy kirlian auras which become incomprehensible beyond one half her kirlian sight.

*Defense Shield (varies)*: A defence shield can only be used against projectile attacks directed at the ventral surface of the knite.
The defense shield can be erected as soon as the knite can outstretch both palms in a defensive gesture.
A defense shield can usually be erected before any attack can be launched.
If there is some debate about getting the defense shield ready, the knite may be forced to make an initiative roll using her MSTR.
If the knite's arms are bound behind her back, she can create a defense shield with her feet at double the degree of difficulty.

A successful PT roll will allow the knite to deflect some attacks and absorb damage from those that are not deflected.
Defense shield allows the knite to absorb 5 hit points of damage and increase her AR by 30 per experience level.
A 3rd level knite could absorb 15 HPS of damage from those attacks that penetrated her increased AR (+90).
If the player fails the PT roll, her persona will take full damage if a hit is scored.

*Pre-empting (special)*: This ability allows the knite to put words into the mouths of weaker people.
A successful PT roll may cause the victim to repeat what the knite has spoken.
The victim receives a save vs.
psionic attack.
If the victim fails to save, she will repeat what the knite has said (or thought) but will not necessarily carry out the action.
Pre-empting can only hope to succeed if the knite can speak the same language as the victim.
There is a much better chance of success if the knite speaks the words aloud.

*Telekinesis (d6 DD)*:  A successful telekinesis roll will allow the knite to move an object by mental concentration.
The object must first be within a range equal to the knite's adjusted MSTR in hexes.
If the object is an unwilling creature, it will receive a save vs psionic attack to avoid being telekinesed.
The wate of the telekinesed object cannot exceed the knite's weight allowance, using MSTR as PSTR.
This amount is then multiplied by one-half of the knite's experience level.
So a knite with a 20 MSTR can telekinese 17 kg at 1st level, and 68 kg at 4th level.
The knite should note that the referee is allowed to make the DD more difficult depending on the size of the item being telekinesed.
If the knite wishes, she can split the total wate of her telekinetic ability amongst one target per 3 levels of experience.

*Pressure (DD7)*:  This skill has different effects but the same result for the two different sects of knite.
A knite can employ pressure to instill overwhelming incapacitating guilt.
Anti-knites can project a sense of asphyxiating fear.
Either format immobilizes its victim.
The victim will remain incapacitated until she saves versus psionic attack or until the knite releases her.
The pressured victim can save versus psionic attack once every 5 units (10 seconds).
A knite can operate pressure on up to 1 target per 3 levels of experience.

*Psionic Defense (4 DD)*:  The knite can focus her MSTR to defend against the mental attack of another knite or the psionic attack of some other opponent.
Psionic defense will allow the knite to save versus any psionic attack regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed or not.
If she saves while employing this mutation, the attack will have no effect on her.
While employing psionic defense, the knite cannot use any of her psionic knite abilities and must cease using any that are being employed.
These include detections, pressure, and telekinesis but do not include lite saber abilities or kirlian sight.
If the PT roll is successful, the knite can add her experience level to her MSTR.
Thus a 4th level knite with a MSTR of 19 would have an MSTR of 23 when employing psionic defense.
The knite must make a PT roll for each attack directed against her.

*Detections*:  The knite can attempt to read kirlian auras in her immediate surroundings.
Successful PT rolls will provide the knite with some information but failed rolls will reveal nothing more than the typical kirlian jumble.

Danger (4 =d6 DD):  When being actively employed by the knite, a successful PT roll will indicate to the knite the location and possibility of impending danger.

Intent (8 + d6 DD):  The knite may use this ability to determine the intent of any biological entity.
Objects radiate kirlian auras but they have no conscience that can reveal actual intent.
The extent of the information revealed by this skill is minimal.
All that can be determined is whether there is good or bad intent directed toward the knite.
Consider some malicious person that wants to throw a fusion grenade at a knite.
A successful detection of intent will only reveal "`bad`" intent, not the fact that the perpetrator has a grenade ready.
Many creatures`' auras cannot be read for intent.
Their auras are disguised through skill (e.g., a spie lying) or just plain stupidity.

Lies (11 + d6 DD):  When a knite is actively observing a creature, she can determine if the spoken dialogue is truthful or not.
The kirlian auras of machines or robots cannot be read for truthfulness.
The knite may observe for one unit per point of MSTR.

Life (12 + d6 DD):  Knites (good sect) may only detect life and anti-knites may only detect death.
The knite may detect life/death at a range of up to 5 hexes per point of adjusted MSTR.
If used properly, this ability can be of equal value to either sect.

Fate (14 + d6 DD):  This is an ability for personas involved in campaigns of truly epic proportions.
Referees and players alike should note that predicting the fate of personas in a situation can lead to sticky entanglements of refs "`forcing`" situations on players regardless of dice rolls.

*Lite Saber Abilities*:  The knite's special weapon is the force field sword, laser sword, or lite saber.
These special weapons are described in detail in Chapter 49: Miscellaneous Weapons.
The knite can do certain things with a lite saber that no other persona can.
All lite saber abilities can be used simultaneously.

*Deflections (Special)*:  The lite saber can be used to deflect an attack.
The DD for this action is 1/50 of the to hit roll made on her.
Attacks can be deflected without affecting the knite's combat in any way.
Attacks can be deflected from any direction provided that the knite hasn't been surprised.
The knite can deflect two attacks per unit per experience level.
Thus a 4th level knite could deflect 8 attacks per unit and she need only deflect those attacks which are going to hit her.

*Multiple Attacks (Automatic)*:  A lite saber can also be used as a lethal attack weapon.
A knite can attack more than once per unit with her lite saber.
She can make one extra attack per unit per two levels of experience.
This is only when using a lite saber and the number of attacks cannot exceed 3 per unit.

*Amputation (Special)*:  The last and most devastating lite saber skill that the knite has is amputation.
The laser lite of the lite saber is capable of excising any limb that it hits.
There is a percentage chance depending on the damage inflicted (this is described under lite sabers) and then a PT roll against a DD equal to 1/50 the target's AR.
Thus knites get 2 chances to amputate each time they score a hit with a lite saber.

*Knite Experience*:  Knites (generic) earn 20 EXPS per DD for successful completion of skills on the performance table.
Knites gain full experience for combat.
The more experience points that the knite collects, the higher the experience level that is attained.
The gathering of experience levels allows for more refined interpretations and manipulations of kirlian auras and thus a higher proficiency with the knite skills.
