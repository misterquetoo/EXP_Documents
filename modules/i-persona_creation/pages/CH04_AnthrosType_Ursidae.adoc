Ursidae have the scientific nomenclature of Homo Ursus.
Ursidae are big, furry bearoids.
They have rotund bodies, bear-like heads and claw-tipped stubby hands.
Regardless of the bear type chosen, the persona remains a bipedal humanoid that naturally possesses no more abilities than those described here.

== hibernation
Ursidae can revert to a hibernation-like stupor in which their metabolism is so slowed that they appear dead.
Only a well trained veterinarian can determine whether a hibernating ursidae is dead or just resting.
Ursidae will only hibernate when they voluntarily decide to do so.
They will not automatically hibernate if they are knocked unconscious (failing a DSS roll).
The persona must be conscious and voluntarily curl up in order to hibernate.
Ursidae cannot hibernate when their HPS totals is negative.
An ursidae with negative HPS is dying like all other anthro personas.

Once bedded down to hibernation, the ursidae will sleep for 1 – 6 days.
this is determined by the referee with a d6 roll and the result is kept secret from the players.
While hibernating, the ursidae will heal on hit point each day for every two points of CON.
So an ursidae hibernating for 4 days with a 14 CON, would heal a total of 28 HPS.
Metabolic poisons have no effect on an ursidae while she’s in hibernation.

During the time of rest, there is a 1/2% chance that the persona will actually slip into a state of permanent sleep, otherwise referred to as death.
At the end of hibernation, the ref makes a kilo-die roll.
If this is less than 005, the ursidae has died due to a severely decreased metabolism.
Remember that only the trained eye can distinguish hibernation from death so uneducated players won’t know an ursidae has kicked the bucket until she starts to smell.

Any attempt to wake an ursidae will have a 7% chance of success regardless of what the attempt is.
For instance, whispering softly into her ear will be as effective as inducing electric shocks.
Only one such attempt can be made each day of hibernation.

== Frenzy
In complete juxtaposition to the ursidae hibernation ability is the frenzied attack.
The persona can revert to this mauling frenzy by choice or when confronted with a situation she cannot readily find a solution for.
When intellectually stumped there is a 5% chance that she will involuntarily go frenzied.
If an ursidae is awakened from her hibernation, there is a 40% chance she will automatically go into her insane violence act.
Once frenzied, the persona has reverted to a claw-driven, non-powered fighting machine.

The persona will drop all weapons of any sort and proceed to rend and tear at the major cause of the dilemma with her bare claws.
When attacking in this frenzied fashion, the ursidae will receive 1 and 1/2 attacks per experience level per unit.
No ursidae can have more than 6 attacks per unit while in a frenzy.
Each attack strikes as a type A weapon and does 1-6 points of damage per hit.
The ursidae can also add 1/2 her PSTR bonus to each hit, turning her into a lethal killing machine.
Thus a 6th level ursidae with an 18 PSTR would get 6 attacks, each capable of inflicting 10 to 15 points of damage.
Frenzied ursidae do not have to make damage system shock rolls and will continue fighting until they are at a negative HPS total.

Homo Ursus frenzy is not the panacea of hand to hand combat that it appears.
The fit will last for 2 to 16 units.
The duration of the attack is rolled by the referee and kept secret from the players.
If an ursidae’s opponents have been eliminated, her frenzy will continue until the duration is up.
This means that she will attack the nearest organic creature for the remainder of the frenzy — be it RPC, player or alien.
So even an ursidae’s best comrades flee until she has calmed down.
Once the frenzy ends, there is a 10% chance that it will continue for another 1-8 units.

== Saving Bonus
Ursidae are particularly hardy and, when saving against cold based attacks, ursidae get +2 on their saving throw.
All cold based attacks do 25% less damage to an ursidae.
