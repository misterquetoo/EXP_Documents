= Artillery

Artillery are a subsection of guns.
An artillery piece is nothing more than a big rifle with an area of effect.
Artillery takes guns and multiplies their range, damage and effects.

*Artillery is very deadly.* 
Misuse of artillery, which is usually guaranteed, can wipe out whole expeditions.
Unless the players like creating personas artillery should be limited in a campaign.

== Artillery Types


=== Annihilator

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iv-hardware:CH46_Guns.adoc#_antimat_rifle[Antimat Rifle]
Weapon Type:: C
Range:: 1500h (15h)
Area of Effect:: 75h
Damage:: 105-240 (1d50+90)
Magazine:: 1 per Battery
Wate:: 375kg (0.5kg) + Battery
EXPS:: 900
Value:: 37500000(1500000) + Battery

The annihilator fires a blob of antimatter suspended in a lattice of electrons.
This lattice shatters at range annihilator nearby matter and creating an explosion.
600 kgs of matter in the target hex is completely destroyed,
The explosion releases a blast of heavy particles and super-heated gases.
Everything within the 75 hex area of effect takes the listed damage.

A malfunction with this weapon means the electron lattice has shattered within the gun.
The artillery piece explodes and inflicts 25-70 (5d10+20) hit points of damage by 2 hexes.

=== Beehive Cannon 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iv-hardware:CH46_Guns.adoc#_bee_gun[Bee Gun]
Weapon Type:: C
Range:: 1500h (15h)
Area of Effect:: 2-12h (2d6)
Damage:: Death
Magazine:: 1
Wate:: 150kg ()
EXPS:: 500
Value:: 3750000 (1500000)

The beehive's activation chamber excites a hive insects into a poisonous rage.
The area of effect is bathed in an explosion of deadly venomous insects.
Every organic creature in the area of effect must win a poison roll or die.
The poison intensity is a ridiculous 57-72 (3d6+54).
Most referees will limit this a poison intensity of 25.
If a person does save she will be comatose for 1-4 (1d4) days.

A malfunction with this weapon indicates that the hive has harmlessly disintegrated in transit.

=== Howitzer

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iv-hardware:CH46_Guns.adoc#_bolt_action_rifle[Bolt Action Rifle]
Weapon Type:: C
Range:: 1200h (12h)
Area of Effect:: 2-12h (2d6)
Damage:: 12-144 (12d12)
Magazine:: 1
Wate:: 278kg (4.5kg)
EXPS:: 400
Value:: 50000 (100)

This is the classic long gun.
Fed by explosive shells and aimed by cranking furiously.

A malfunction destroys the weapon and inflicts 12-144 (12d12) hit points of damage in the firing hex..

=== Glacier Gun 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iv-hardware:CH46_Guns.adoc#_cryogun[Cryogun]
Weapon Type:: C
Range:: 100h (1h)
Area of Effect:: 6h wide 
Damage:: 12-72 (12d6)
Magazine:: 1 per Battery
Wate:: 150kg + Battery
EXPS:: 700
Value:: 600000 + Battery

The glacier gun freezes everything within its 6 hex by 100 hex area of effect.
Each point of damage equals a % chance of being entrapped in ice
So 25 HPS of damage indicates a 25% of being entrapped in the ice.
The chance to break free is a Tough physical strength challenge.
Trapped targets will be cold and trapped until the glacier melts.
The glacier melts in 18 to 180 units (18d10).

A misfire with this weapon results in a loss of all battery power.

This weapon is also called a Cryo Cannon.

=== Disintegrator 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iv-hardware:CH46_Guns.adoc#_disintegration_gun[Disintegration Gun]
Weapon Type:: C
Range:: 1000h (10h)
Area of Effect:: 2-12h (2d6)
Damage:: 24-192 (24d8)
Magazine:: 1 per Battery
Wate:: 338kg + Battery
EXPS:: 900
Value:: 50000000 + Battery 

The disintegrator turns solids into elemental particles. 
The nicely organized matter is turned into a chaotic cloud of dust.
This artillery is temperamental and outcomes vary each time it is fired.
Like all good disintegration weapons it is capable of making a target disappear.
Every target in the area of effect takes 24-192 (24d8) hit points in damage.
If the disintegration cascade starts much more damage follows.

.*Disintegration Cascade*
Everything in the area of effect has a chance of disintegrating. 
The disintegration cascade will affect 3-300 (3d100) kgs of wate.
The amount of disintegrated matter is rolled for each persona in the area of effect.
The greater the amount of matter affected the greater the chance the cascade will fail.
There is a 1% chance per kg of matter that the attack will fail.

So an attack that is affecting 42 kgs of a target has a 42 percent chance of failing.
Basically the player immediately rolls the 1d100 again. 
If the second roll is greater than the amount of wate things disintegrate.
Using the above example of a 42 kg cascade the player immediately rolls again.
If the roll is 42 or higher the cascade is successful and 42 kgs disappears.
If the roll is 41 or lower the cascade fails and the weapon inflicts 24-192 (24d8) hit points.

The disintegration cascade failure only applies to organic targets. 
Robots, equipment, walls and structures automatically cascade. 
So a robot in the area of effect first takes 24-192 (24d8) hit points.
Then loses 3-300 (3d100) kgs of wate. 

.*Disintegration Damage*
If the target has a wate less than the amount of matter disintegrated it disappears.
If it is a persona she is irrevocably destroyed and suffering classic disintegration.
Partial disintegration inflicts 1-20 (1d20) hit points in damage per kg destroyed.
For example, a 100 kg target that has 20 kg disintegrated will take 24-192 (24d8) plus 20-400 (20d20).
Very few personas survive a disintegration event. 

A malfunction of this artillery destroys the weapon and damages the firer.

=== Electron Cannon 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iv-hardware:CH46_Guns.adoc#_electron_rifle[Electron Rifle]
Weapon Type:: D
Range:: 1700h (17h)
Area of Effect:: 2-12h (2d6)
Damage:: 15-150 (15d10)
Magazine:: 2 per Battery
Wate:: 315kg + Battery
EXPS:: 750
Value:: 2000000 + Battery

An electron cannon blasts a beam of electrons massacre the target's molecules.
The cannon inflicts damage to every target in the area of effect.
An electron cannon's area of effect damage is unaffected by force fields.
The blast was damages the force field as well as any persona within the force field.

A malfunction of this cannon wastes all remaining charges.

=== Fission Artillery 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iv-hardware:CH46_Guns.adoc#_fission_rifle[Fission Rifle]
Weapon Type:: E
Range:: 1100h (11h)
Area of Effect:: 2-12h (2d6)
Damage:: 18-126 (18d12)
Magazine:: 3 per Battery
Wate:: 319kg + Battery
EXPS:: 950
Value:: 32000000 + Battery

Fission artillery creates an energy wave that superheats hydrogen molecules.
Obviously this weapon can only be used in hydrogen laden atmospheres (air and water are good examples).
Charges are still drained if the weapon is fired in the absence of hydrogen.
This device is thoroughly waterproofed.

A malfunctions will indicate a backflash, resulting in damage to the firer.


=== Howglitzer 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iv-hardware:CH46_Guns.adoc#_full_auto_lazer_rifle[Full Auto Lazer Rifle]
Weapon Type:: C, F
Range:: 1200h (12h)
Area of Effect:: 2-12h (2d6)
Damage:: 15-150 (15d10)
Magazine:: 15 per Battery
Wate:: 308kg + Battery
EXPS:: 700
Value:: 12000000 + Battery

The Howglitzer is fully automated lazer cannon.
Like all artillery each hit represents an area of effect.
When full auto is activated the amount of damage becomes astronomical. 

The Howglitzer can fire once a unit (type C) 15 times in a row.
If there is available battery the Howglitzer can launch a volley of lazer attacks.
The type F releases 15 charges in one unit.
The player makes 5 to hit rolls in one unit.
Each successful to hit roll scores 1-3 (1d3) area of effect attacks.
It is possible to deliver 225-2250 hit points of damage in the area of effect.
Personas skilled in artillery may spread the area of effect hits to cover a larger area.

For a discussion of full auto (flotto) attacks jump to xref:ii-roll_playing_rules:CH28_Weapons.adoc#_type_f_attacks[Type F Attacks].

A more technical title would be a Full Auto Lazer Cannon or Flotto Lazer Artillery.

A malfunction of this artillery results in a wasted charge.
So 1 charge for weapon type C attack or 15 charges for weapon type F. 

=== Howblitzer 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iv-hardware:CH46_Guns.adoc#_full_auto_rifle[Full Auto Rifle]
Weapon Type:: C, F
Range:: 900h (9h)
Area of Effect:: 2-12h (2d6)
Damage:: 12-144 (12d12)
Magazine:: 15
Wate:: 293kg (4.3kg)
EXPS:: 700
Value:: 1200000 (25)

The Howblitzer is a rapid fire howitzer to blitz the enemy with long arcing carnage.
Like all artillery each hit represents an area of effect.
When full auto is activated the amount of damage becomes cataclysmic. 

The Howblitzer can fire once a unit (type C) 15 times in a row.
If there is available ammunition the Howblitzer can launch a volley of lazer attacks.
The type F releases 15 shells in one unit.
The player makes 5 to hit rolls in one unit.
Each successful to hit roll scores 1-3 (1d3) area of effect attacks.
It is possible to deliver 180-2160 hit points of damage in the area of effect.
Personas skilled in artillery may spread the area of effect hits to cover a larger area.

A malfunction represents a dud shell and a weapon jam.

=== Fusion Cannon 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iv-hardware:CH46_Guns.adoc#_fusion_rifle[Fusion Rifle]
Weapon Type:: C
Range:: 900h (9h)
Area of Effect:: 9h swath
Damage:: Special
Magazine:: 1 per Battery
Wate:: 600kg (1kg) + Battery
EXPS:: 900
Value:: 8000000 (200000) + Battery

The fusion cannon launches a blob of fusion that creates a conflagration.
Fusion artillery casts a 900 by 9 hex swath of incinerating death.

The first casualty of a fusion cannon is the battery crew.
Firing releases a fusion backflash that can delivers tremendous damage.
Those firing the fusion cannon take 18-180 (18d10) hit points in damage.
The backflash has a 3 hex area of effect.
Only personas sporting powered armour or special shielding are safe.

Target Size::
This weapon annihilates any persona large sized or smaller.
Large and smaller personas are killed instantly in the area of effect.
Tiny, Small, Medium and Large targets explode and turn into collateral damage.
Gigantic targets do not explode. 
Gigantic targets take Swath and Collateral Damage. 

Swath Damage::
Swath damage is an inescapable area of effect damage along the path of the fusion blob.
Targets that do not explode first take swath damage.
The swath delivers 24-240 (24d10) hit points in damage.

Collateral Damage::
Everything exploded by the fusion cannon swath explodes outwards in collateral damage.
The boiling flesh and bits of bone hurtle outward from the swath path.
This steaming goo of collateral colleagues is 3 hexes on either side of the swath. 
Collateral damage inflicts 21-210 (21d10) hit points of damage.
This damage is dealt to any person within 3 hexes of the swath.
It is also dealt to any persona that survives within the swath. 

A gigantic persona in the swath would take a combined swath and collateral damage.
This would be 45-450 (45d10) hit points of damage.

A malfunction with the expedition eradicator will inflict 24-240 hit points of damage to all within 15 hexes.

=== Mag Cannon 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iv-hardware:CH46_Guns.adoc#_gauss_rifle[Gauss Rifle]
Weapon Type:: E
Range:: 1900h (19h)
Area of Effect:: 2-12h (2d6)
Damage:: 15-180 (15d12)
Magazine:: 3
Wate:: 281kg (5.6kg)
EXPS:: 754
Value:: 1200000 (500)

The mag cannon magnetically hurls specialized ammunition.
Each round is a combination of battery and projectile.
The battery expends it's energy to propel itself at lethal velocity.
There are no casings ejected.
A mag cannon has little kickback.
Low kickback helps with the cannon's accuracy and utility in zero gravity.
The weapon is quiet but not entirely silent.

The mag cannon is also called a rail gun.

A malfunction indicates an ammo defect and must be manually removed.

=== Whale Gun 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iv-hardware:CH46_Guns.adoc#_grapple_gun[Grapple Gun]
Weapon Type:: C
Range:: 150h (2h)
Area of Effect:: None
Damage:: 12-72 (12d6)
Magazine:: 1
Wate:: 226kg
EXPS:: 700
Value:: 400000 (25)

The whale gun fires a giant adherent device attached to a high tensile cable.
The weapon is designed to impale enormous targets like space vehicles.
The business end is combination of spikes, barbs and adherent materials.
A successful attack roll delivers the damage and connects the cannon to the target.

The whale gun can reel in 10 tonnes of target at 5 hu.
The whale gun must be mounted to a stable deck or it will fly off.
If the target is too big the whale gun will reel itself to the target.

The grapple end can be reeled back in over 3 units if the attack roll fails.

A malfunction with this weapon indicates a mechanism jam.

=== Grav Cannon 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iv-hardware:CH46_Guns.adoc#_gravruptor_gun[Gravruptor Gun]
Weapon Type:: C
Range:: 300h (3h)
Area of Effect:: 2-12h (2d6)
Damage:: Special
Magazine:: 1 per Battery
Wate:: 293kg + Battery
EXPS:: 700
Value:: 400000 + Battery

The grav cannon inflicts gravitational anomalies to disrupt and damage.
The area of effect is subject to a blast of random gravity.
The gravruptor is ineffective against target's with a wate greater than 5000kg.

The grav cannon inflicts 3-12 (3d4) gravities to the area of effect.
The cannon inflicts 1-20 (1d20) hit points per gravity of acceleration.
The direction of the gravity attack is determined each time the cannon is fired.
Experienced artillery experts are able to control the direction of the gravities.

include::ROOT:partial$CH46_Table_Gravruptor_Effects.adoc[]

All of the above effects are described for a normal gravity world.
What effects this gun has on high gravity and low gravity planets depends entirely on the ref.

The grav cannon is designed for zero gravity combat.
The weapon has no recoil and is designed to launch targets into space.
In zero gravity (ZOG) targets will are flung away at 1 h/u per 2 hit points of damage.
Thus a hit that inflicts 20 hit points of damage would send the target racing off into space at an uncontrolled movement rate of 10 h/u.

The grav cannon is also known as an accelerator, or a gravity cannon.

A malfunction with this weapon will result in a gravitational anomaly attacking the weapon and weapon holder.


=== Garbage Cannon 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:iv-hardware:CH46_Guns.adoc#_job_rifle[Job Rifle]
Weapon Type:: C
Range:: 1000h (10h)
Area of Effect:: 2-12h (2d6)
Damage:: Special
Magazine:: 1 per Battery
Wate:: 300kg + Battery
EXPS:: 500
Value:: 17500 + Battery

The JOB cannon can launch 10 kg of anything up to its maximum range.
If it is 10 kg of junk the kinetic attack will inflict 9 to 90 His in damage.
The cannon could also launch 10 kg worth of grenades, or poison gas.


The garbage cannon employs a combination gauss, spring and vacuum chamber mechanism.
This allows the rifle to turn any solid material into a lethal projectile.
JOB is an acronym for Jack Of all Bullets.
To load the weapon dump about at least 2kg of loose of material into the chamber.
Sand, rocks, plastic, batteries, or bullets will hurtle out with lethal velocity.
Each 2 kilogram load of detritus is good for 5 shots.


A garbage cannon has no specific ammunition. 
This weapon is also called a job cannon, junk gun or garbage can.

A malfunction with this weapon indicates a weapon jam.

Zap zap.
Boom boom.

== 16) Miscellaneator 

// insert table 422

Miscellaneator is an artillery sized version of an appropriate weapon from the miscellaneous weapons chapter (49).
Miscellaneator could be a huge black hole, a gigantic spinning wheel of death, or a flare cannon (for use when stranded on a planet).
The referee should roll on the Miscellaneous Weapon Table until she finds an appropriate weapon.
For instance, compucrafted sword would be inappropriate, but compucrafted crossbow might well be.
As would rocket assisted weapons.
The miscellaneator gets very insane very fast.
If this type of weapon would imbalance a campaign or mess up a milieu simply ignore it.
Story trumps die rolling chaos.

== Artillery Attribute Explanations

=== Artillery Creator Template

[horizontal]
Weapon Type:: Same as gun
Range:: 10 times (1/10 minimum)
Area of Effect:: 3 times or 2-12h 
Damage:: 3 times highest
Magazine:: C=1 D=2 E=3 F=15
Wate:: 75 times heaviest Ammo % or 50 times
EXPS:: Same
Value:: 100 times


=== Range 

Artillery has both a maximum range, and a minimum range.
The minimum range of an artillery piece is 1/10 of the maximum range listed for the base gun type.
An artillery piece's maximum range is 10 times the maximum range of the base gun type.
If the rifle had a range of 80 hexes, it would have a minimum range of 8 hexes and maximum range of 800 hexes.
Minimum range is unique to artillery, and it means that it simply cannot attack anything closer than that.
Most artillery would destroy itself, and its crew, if it were used even at the minimum range.
Targets at less than minimum range and beyond the maximum range cannot be hit accurately, although the large area of effect may accommodate for the restriction.
The minimum range is included in brackets beside the maximum range.

=== Area of Effect 

The area of effect will be 3 times the listed area of effect, or a randomly assigned area of effect of 2 to 12 hexes.
The value represents a radius of effect taken from the hex that the shell lands in.
Those artillery listed with a &8216;random'
area of effect will make a 2d6 dice roll to determine it.

=== Damage 

The damage inflicted by the artillery will be three times that of the rifle that the cannon is modelled after.
If only one damage range is shown on the base gun type, the artillery attack will inflict triple that damage.
For instance a fission rifle inflicts 6 to 72 (6d12) hit points in damage.
Artillery modelled after this gun would inflict 18 to 216 (18d12) hit points in damage to all targets within the area of effect.
If the base gun has several damage types the artillery piece will inflict three times the highest damage type listed.
The full automatic rifle's damage is listed as 4-48, 4-32, 3-30, 3-24, 2-20.
These damages are for different calibre guns.
Artillery has its own calibre, and it is big.
The artillery will inflict three times the largest caliber, or 12 to 144 (12d12) hit points in damage to all targets in the area of effect.

=== Accuracy 

The accuracy statistic of the rifle does not apply to artillery.
To be able to operate artillery the persona must make a successful Performance Table* *roll to understand the device, aim it, and then make a to hit roll.
Misses with artillery are left to be decided by the referee.
If a quick and dirty system is needed then consult the Grenade Miss table in http://expgame.com/?page_id=304[Chapter 30: Grenade and]http://expgame.com/?page_id=304[Aerosol Combat].
The listed table values are multiplied tenfold, of course.
Personas without artillery skill cannot attack, other than randomly, with an artillery piece.

=== Magazine 

Artillery has a magazine.
The magazine size is equivalent to the highest rate of fire capable by the base gun type.
An artillery piece modelled after a type C base gun type would have a 1 round magazine, so it would have to be reloaded after each shot.
A fully automatic base weapon would yield an artillery magazine with a capacity of 15 rounds, if it were fired full-auto, it would need to be reloaded each round.
Reloading of artillery depends entirely on the skill of the firers, but it can never get faster than 1 to 4 units per reload.
Energy artillery that requires batteries will employ some power plant source, or use 20 times the number of batteries required by the base weapon type.

=== Wate 

The artillery piece will have a WATE 75 times greater than the base gun type's WATE.
If the base gun type has several wates listed, the largest one will be multiplied by 75.
Base gun types that have a % ammo system use the % ammo value for the WATE of their artillery shells.
Artillery shells modelled after gun ammos which have a standard ammo WATE will be 50 times heavier than the base gun ammo.
The wate of the ammo is shown in brackets.

=== Malfunction 

Artillery is 1.5 times more likely to malfunction than the base gun type it is modelled after.
Artillery being used by unskilled firers is 4 times more likely to malfunction than the malfunction chance listed for the artillery.

=== EXPS 

Artillery weapons are worth the same amount of experience as the base gun type.


=== Value 

The value of the artillery is equal to 100 times the value of the gun it was modelled after.
The value of the artillery ammo, shells, pellets, or whatever is 25 times the value the base gun type's.
The Ammo Value is included in brackets.

// firing mechanism complexity skill level etc.
