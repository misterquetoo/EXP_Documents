Constitution represents a persona’s internal physique.
The main components of CON are the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys and immune system.
A high CON is better to repel disease, resist poisons, and repair damaged tissue.

The constitution represents internal hardiness it points.
The relationship between CON and HPS is detail and directly influences structural integrity as well.
The CON is used to determine the persona's HPS.

The CON attribute is rolled on 3d6.  If a persona’s CON should drop below 1, she is irrevocably dead due to combined heart, liver, kidney and immune system failure.

== Damage System Shock (DSS)
A player must make a check to remain conscious whenever more than half her remaining hit points are lost at one time.
This check means the player must make a % roll or her persona will lose consciousness or be stunned due to trauma.
In order to ‘make’ a damage system shock, the player must roll a percentile dice score that is lower than her damage system shock value (DSS).
The DSS roll must be less than 3 times her remaining hit points total.
If a player with a 5 CON and 20 hit points were to take 10 hit points of damage, she would have to roll less than 30 on deci-dice or be knocked out.
Failing the DSS roll means that her persona’s system could not withstand the trauma that it just received and the persona has succumbed to unconsciousness.
This is explained in greater detail later in this chapter under Hit Points.

== Recovery Roll (REC)
The Constitution Table shows the duration of time until the player can make a recovery roll.
A recovery roll is also dependant on the persona’s hit points total.
A recovery roll would be required before a persona could recover from a failed DSS roll.
The recovery roll is where the player checks to see if her personal has recovered from previous damage.
The recovery roll is a deci-die roll less than 5 times her remaining HPS.
Let’s assume the above player failed her (DSS) roll.
her persona would collapse unconscious from the damage and remain unconscious unless she rolled less than 5 times her remaining HPS; which, in this case, is 50%.
However, she could only attempt a recovery roll after 16 units (according to her duration) and, if she failed it, then she would have to wait another 16 units before trying again.
