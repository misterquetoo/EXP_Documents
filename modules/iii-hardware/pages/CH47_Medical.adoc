= Veterinary Equipment

Veterinary equipment is designed to repair organic machines.
Each piece of vet equipment performs its own private miracle, but nothing does everything, and some things do nothing.
Even though the equipment is highly advanced, the equipment still requires some input from so-called professionals.
Veterinarians are the primary users of vet artifacts.
Most artifacts merely require a single vet to point the device correctly.
While other artifacts require an entire xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH14_Performance_Tables.adoc#_research_teams[Research Teams].

Hopefully, vet equipment will not only be used to repair the wounded from battle, but to heal the sick, aid the needy, and other humanitarian efforts (ha!).
The attributes of vet equipment are detailed in the following paragraphs.

== Veterinary Equipment Types

=== Age Determiner 

[horizontal]
Duration:: 5 years
Bonuses:: +20 age related rolls, +10 time related rolls
Wate:: 1kg
EXPS:: 200
Value:: 5000

The age determiner estimates the age of organic personas.
The biological age of whatever the little black box is pointed at shows on a screen.
The device would require adjustment to be used on microscopic organisms.
The age determiner has off label uses that come in handy. 
The device can help detect a disguise, notice a time space aberration, or detect an ambush.


=== Anesthetics Mask 

[horizontal]
Duration:: 5 hours
Bonuses:: +30 surgery; +40 on comfort
Wate:: 1.2kg
EXPS:: 10
Value:: 6000

An anesthetics mask looks like a gas mask with dials and indicators.
The mask will render any organic anthro unconscious for the time set on the mask.
This is a pain free state similar to being maintained under general anesthetic.
However no pharmacological agents are employed.
Once applied the mask immediately takes over.
It is virtually impossible to subject an unwilling patient to the anesthetics mask.

The mask should not be prematurely removed from the subject.
If the anthro is not returned to consciousness by the mask badness can happen.
There is a 2% chance that unconsciousness will persist for 1-100 days.
The mask can only anesthetize one anthro at a time.


=== Anti Aging Beam 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Power Source
Bonuses:: +40 age related rolls
Wate:: 150kg
EXPS:: 200
Value:: 50000

This machine bastes the organic persona with information encoded energy.
This data can technomagically reprogram cells that are aging adversely.
Treatments take place over 1-4 (1d4) days and last an hour each.
Any treatment interruptions require the treatment to start over.
Getting injured in combat would be considered a treatment interruption.

The beam is not a fountain of youth.
This artifact repairs unnatural aging that the persona has been subject to.
For instance, aging due to chrono attack weapons, or special drive accidents.

The anti aging beam heals 3-30 (3d10) years per chronologic damage.
The de-aging process does not heal lost attributes.
To repair damaged attributes requires a <<_rejuv_chamber,Rejuv Chamber>>.
A persona aged to 52 years suffers PSTR and DEX penalties.
The anti aging beam could repair the chronologic years but not the attribute drops.

The persona remains phenotypically the same.
The anti-aging beam cannot turn an adult into a child.
If the persona is accidentally aged to less than 1 year she is dead.
Over use of the anti-aging beam can easily kill the patient.

A vet can adjust the amount of de-aging carried out. 
The more control she needs the higher the degree of difficulty.

=== Anti Mutation Beam 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Power Source
Bonuses:: +30 mutation related rolls
Wate:: 150kg
EXPS:: 2000
Value:: 200000

This machine bastes the organic persona with information encoded energy.
This data can technomagically reprogram cells that have mutated.
The beam can be used to restructure personas into their original organic forms.

The artifact is good for removing defective mutations.
However it cannot tell the difference between defective and advantaged mutations.
The beam also only works on mutations.
It would have no effect on an alien's mutation like natural ability.
The beam would have no effect on a robotic peripheral that mimics a mutation.
If the robot or alien developed a mutation after fabrication or evolution this beam would work.

While under the beam physical mutations shrivel up and fall off the mutant.
Mental mutations simply stop working.
If a player feels that her mutation is an ability or evolutionary trait the xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH16_Special_Rolls_Asshole.adoc[Sphincter Dice] can be consulted.

The persona must fail a poison roll for the mutation to be affected by the beam.
The intensity of the beam is 2-12 (2d6) plus the vet's experience level and skills.
The player can swap the direction of the poison roll if they do not want to lose the mutation. 
Anti mutant groups can use the beam to punish mutated anthros.
The player uses CON for physical mutation and MSTR for mental mutations.

The beam has a 40 cm range, and its effect is instantaneous and irreversible.

If a veterinarian wishes to focus the beam she must win a performance roll.
Physical mutations add 3DD per physical mutation.
Mental mutations add 10DD per mental mutation.
If a vet wanted to eliminate a mutant's pus producing organ, while retaining her symbiotic attachment and pyrokinesis the vet would have to make a 16DD maneuver.

=== Anti Virus Beam 

[horizontal]
Duration:: 200 unit per Battery
Bonuses:: +20 on infection rolls
Wate:: 5kg + Battery
EXPS:: 1000
Value:: 100000

The anti-virus beam will damage foreign micro-organisms infiltrating an organic substance.
This includes viral, bacterial, fungal, or prion infection.
The beam will not kill symbiotic organisms that are good for the persona.
This super-sterilizer has a range of 75 cm.

This usually does *not* include nano machines or exoplanetary micro-organisms.
Whether this works on a robot with an organic infection requires xref:ii-roll_playing_rules:CH16_Special_Rolls_Asshole.adoc[Sphincter Dice].


=== Auto Tourniquet 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Unlimited
Bonuses:: +20 limb or bleeding rolls
Wate:: 1.5kg
EXPS:: 250
Value:: 750

An automatic tourniquet can be wrapped over or near any major source of blood loss.
The tourniquet is more than just an automated constricting bandage.
This artifact employs electrical impulses to constrict the appropriate vessels. 
The tourniquet can assist on a severely damaged limb, internal bleed, or head wound.
If the tourniquet has safety mechanisms to prevent malicious placement.
The auto tourniquet does not heal damage, but does prevent further damage.
The electric tourniquet will always function (no batteries necessary) if attached to a warm organic creature.
Veterinarians earn +20 on any PT rolls that involve blood loss (surgery to severe trauma).

=== Blind Goggles

[horizontal]
Duration:: 12 months per Battery
Bonuses:: Nil
Wate:: 500 gm (includes Battery)
EXPS:: 960
Value:: 200000 + Battery

Blind goggles will restore sight to an anthro persona struck by visual impairment.
The goggles do not enhance regular vision, but may be stylish.
The goggles restore sight up to a range of 1 hex per point of AWE.
This distance is halved in darkness.
So a persona with an awareness of 12 could see 12 hexes normally and 6 hexes at night.

[horizontal]
Duration:: 150 unit per Battery
Bonuses:: +20 for blood related procedures
Wate:: 2kg + Battery
EXPS:: 1300
Value:: 35000 + Battery

This device can be used by any veterinarian to destroy build-ups of organic material that inhibit the flow of blood through normal channels.
If the vet succeeds with this DD3 maneuver, clotting can be disrupted in any of the anthro types.
Once the location of a clot is determined, it can be disrupted in 1-3 units.
There is a standard, whole body 15-unit treatment that will eliminate 99% of malignant clots in the body.

Weaponizing this device yields unpredictable results.
Each attack drains 30 units of battery power.
Five attacks would drain a full battery.
It attacks as a type C weapon with a next hex maximum range.
A successful attack roll will inflict 2-12 (2d6) hit points of hemorrhage damage.
A hit is followed by a chance of prolonged bleeding.
There is 1% chance per hit point of damage of inflicting a major bleed.
A major bleed will inflicts an additional 5-50 (5d10) hit points of damage.

=== Blood Congealer 

[horizontal]
Duration:: 1800 units per Battery
Bonuses:: +10 for blood related procedures
Wate:: 1.7kg
EXPS:: 800
Value:: 25000 + Battery

The Blood congealer activates the clotting pathways freezing the flow of blood.
Any persona can use the device can be used to create scabs on surface bleeding.
Only a vet can use a blood congealer to control internal bleeding.
To control internal bleeding is a DD3 maneuver with a blood congealer.
When combatting blood loss the vet will earn +20 on her PT roll.

Weaponizing this device yields unpredictable results.
Each attack drains 300 units of battery power.
Six attacks would drain a full battery.
It attacks as a type C weapon with a next hex maximum range.
A successful attack roll will inflict 2-12 (2d6) hit points of clotting damage.
A hit is followed by a chance of a major embolus.
There is 1% chance per hit point of damage of causing a major embolus.
A major embolus will inflicts an additional 5-50 (5d10) hit points of damage.

=== Bone Setter 

[horizontal]
Duration:: 90 minutes per Battery
Bonuses:: +20 for bone related rolls
Wate:: 8kg + Battery
EXPS:: 1500
Value:: 3000

The Bone Setter accelerates the repair of any anthro's structural elements.
Structural elements includes bones, cellulose, exoskeletons or mutated limbs. 
Fractures, cavities, cancers, deformities, and ligaments are technomagically repaired.

A treatment uses 1-10 minutes of a 90 minute charge.
Any persona can use the bone setter to heal 1-6 (1d6) of damage to obvious trauma.
A vet can extend this healing into daily rehab.
The bone setter cannot be weaponized.

=== Breath Ball 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Single use
Bonuses:: +25 for resuscitation related procedures.
Wate:: 500gm
EXPS:: 1500
Value:: 3000

The breath ball is a temporary self contained ventilation gas exchanger.
A conscious persona can stuff the ball into her ventilation orifice to breath safely.
The ball will offer oxygen or carbon dioxide (florians) to the breathing persona.
This allows personas to breath under water.
The breath ball also filters out respiratory poisons from the air. 
The ball basically will work for a few hours to get the persona through a tight pinch.
This device does not act as long term life support or protect against exatmo.

A vet can use the ball to both ventilate and oxygenate an unconscious persona.

A vet can jam the breath ball into an unconscious persona's digestion orifice.
The ball will take over ventilation and oxygen exchange for hours. 
In the case of florians carbon dioxide is delivered.
The breath ball will maintain the persona for a few minutes to get through a tight pinch.
This device does not act as long term life support or protect against exatmo.

There is no way to weaponize a breath ball.


=== Cardio Vest 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Single use
Bonuses:: +25 for resuscitation related procedures.
Wate:: 2.9kg 
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 1200

Any persona can put this vest on to regulate and monitor cardiac pump function.
If needed the cardio vest will rhythmically contract pumping the heart and lungs.
This will keep vital fluids moving regardless if it is blood or sap.
The cardio vest will maintain the persona for a few minutes to get through a tight pinch.
This device does not act as long term life support.

There is no way to weaponize a breath ball.

=== Cerebro Converter 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Power Source
Bonuses:: +30 on thinkspace rolls
Wate:: 1000kg
EXPS:: 10000
Value:: 11300000000

A cerebro converter can analyze and copy any organic storage device.
In most cases this will be an anthro brain.
The information is converted to electrical storage, and becomes  transferrable.
The cerebro converter switches a consciousness from one brain to another.
Some of its uses include brainwashing, ultimate disguises, and immortality.

The cerebro conversion transfers the consciousness of one anthro into another.
This moves the emotions, memories, skills, and mental strength between brains.
The brain receiving the consciousness has it's previous consciousness obliterated.
The body which the consciousness left becomes a vegetative husk.
The converted consciousness now lives in a new body.
The physical attributes of the new body do not change. 
AWE, CHA, CON, DEX, PSTR and HPS remain the same.
There is a new INT, MSTR, personality, memories, vocation and EXPS in the new brain. 

IMPORTANT: *These actions are ethically dubious and medically dangerous.*

Cerebro conversion is a dangerous maneuver for the personas, players and the referee.
For the personas, there is a high chance of death, insanity, and mental loss.
The users must be aware that the cerebro converter is indiscriminate, and all knowledge (family life, loves, hates, gossip) is transferred into the receiving brain.
This can cause an infinity of problems. 
If properly exploited by the referee can translate into an endless source of fun.
Any procedure failure, like a power failure, interruption by combat, or a failed performance roll will result in an adverse effect.
The adverse effects of cerebro conversion are drastic indeed.

Success::
The base chance for success of the cerebro conversion is the ratio between the receiver's INT and the donor's combined INT and MSTR.

=== Chance of Cerebro Conversion Success
.(INT + MSTR of donor) / (INT + MSTR receiver)
****
It is more difficult to wipe a more intelligent mind. +
The referee may include experience level on either side of the fraction.
****

For example, the donor has a 6 INT and 6 MSTR and the receiver has a 9 INT and a 9 MSTR.
There is a 66% (12/18) chance of the cerebro conversion being successful.
More often than not the chance of successful conversion will be >100% 
Personas that have inorganic brains and therefore no mental strength have a 25 INT.

.*There are two parts required for success*
For the cerebro conversion to be a success the vet must also win a performance roll.
Even if the conversion is successful the vet can still mess up the procedure.
It is strongly recommended to build xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH14_Performance_Tables.adoc#_research_teams[Research Teams] for this performance roll.

Failure:: 
If the conversion roll is a failure there can be no conversion.
The vet can prevent an adverse effect by winning a performance roll.
If the conversion fails and the vet fails there is a side effect.

If the vet fails her performance roll and conversion was a success nothing happens.
There is no conversion and there are no side effects

Machine Failure:: 
The cerebro converter has a chance of breaking under the duress of a failed conversion.
If both the conversion and the vet fail their rolls the machine may malfunction.
The chance of machine failure and damage is 1% per DD of maneuver.
So if the degree of difficulty is 20 there is a 20% chance of machine break down.
Jump to xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH21_Artifact_Damage.adoc#_extent_of_damage[Equipment Damage] to see how bad things are.

Brain Failure:: 
Many of the cerebro conversion side effects are serious.
They often involve competition between two partially converted consciousnesses.
Both consciousnesses are radically altered in preparation for conversion.
Brain failures affect both of the persona brains and consciousnesses.

include::ROOT:partial$CH47_Table_Cerebro_Converter_Side_Effects.adoc[]

Insanity::
There is a minor mixing of consciousnesses and a battle for control. 
This battle is expressed as a fresh new insanity in the mixed up brain.
Each persona is afflicted with an insanity.
The referee can force the player to win a MSTR roll or succumb to the insanity.
Jump to xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH11_Referee_Personas_Anthro.adoc#_introverted[mild insanity] for some inspiration.

Mind Blank::
All data banks, levels of experience, memories, skills, are wiped clean.
This applies to any storage format attached to the cerebro converter.
Most often a brain gets blanked but computers, robots and AI are susceptible.
A player persona must win a mental strength roll or get blanked.
A referee persona getting blanked depends on the story.
The duration of the fugue is also based on the story.
Figments of memory can be a wonderful tool to aid story progress.

Dominance::
Dominance is a confusing mix of two consciousnesses.
Each consciousness has been copied without the previous one being erased.
The two consciousnesses coexist in two different brains and battle for dominance.

Dominance calls on the improvisational talents of the referee and the players.
The most common way to run this adverse effect is as follows:
The dominant mental strength rules it's own brain most of the time.
The less dominant consciousness will appear at inopportune moments to improve the story.
This may swap the bodies between two personas and therefore players.
So two players, a player and a referee or two referee personas may be swapping back and forth.
The dominance of their brain and body changing along with their persona record sheets.

This consciousness dominance battle crosses organic and inorganic consciousnesses.
If a player is trying to dominate her persona she must win an intelligence roll.
It is possible for dominance to end the playable life of a player persona.

The cerebro converter comes with a warning to personas, players and referees. 

Death::
Death by cerebro converter is total.
The persona's consciousness is wiped along with all essential unconscious supports.
Organics are mind blanked along with all cardiorespiratory autoregulatory mechanisms.
Inorganics are erased along with all support daemons. 
All that is left after cerebro converter death is a lifeless husk.

Each persona, or device, on the cerebro converter must win a mental strength roll or die.
Robots use their intelligence as mental strength for this attack.
The MSTR roll goes against the degree of difficulty of the vet maneuver.
So lower tech converters are more likely to kill their patients. 

Mental Mutation:: 
Each persona must win a mental strength roll or suffer a xref:v-wetware:CH58_Mental.adoc#_defective_mutations[Defective Mental Mutation].
The mental strength is up against the DD of the vet maneuver for the converter.
If a referee is feeling generous the player may roll on the 
xref:v-wetware:CH58_Mental.adoc#_mutation_type[Mental Mutation Table]. 

.*Less Failure Through Science*
The higher the tech level of the cerebro converter, the more effective the device is.
The tech level of the cerebro converter is represented by it's wate.
The impacts of tech level on artifacts is cover in xref:iv-software:CH56_Tech_Level.adoc[Tech Level].
The tech level of the cerebro converter is represented by it's wate.
The lower the converter's wate the higher it's tech level.

When the degree of difficulty to operate the machine is high xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH14_Performance_Tables.adoc#_research_teams[Research Teams] are recommended.
A research team can be composed vets and biologists.
Occasionally other vocations can be added to the research team.

The Cerebro Converter Tech table limits the type of conversion that can be completed.
A low tech cerebro converter can only transpose a consciousness between similar patients.
As the tech level increases more complex transfers are possible.

=== Cloning Equipment 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Power Source
Bonuses:: +20 on cloning related rolls
Wate:: 2500kg
EXPS:: 25000
Value:: 5000000000

Cloning Equipment functions like a biologic printer building an exact organic replica.
The clone will is a verbatim cellular construct.
It is an autonomous statue made from made from matching meats and ligaments.

NOTE: *To copy the body and consciousness of a sample requires both cloning equipment and a cerebro converter.*

However the consciousness of the sample is not transferred.
The fresh body lacks personality, mental strength and training of the cloned brain.
The clone copies the cellular maturity, but not the vocation or experience.
The sample has no control over the clone.
The clone cannot speak, and usually becomes a referee persona.

Sample Size::
The more advanced the cloning equipment the less of a sample is needed.
A low tech cloning machine needs to have a living body present for the entire process.
This is very time  consuming and can be dangerous for the living sample.
A high tech cloning machine needs only to have a small chunk of the organism present.
Cloning is a slightly destructive process and the sample can be damaged or destroyed.
Little bits of the sample are snipped off and homogenized into genetic components.

Cloning Success::
The cloning process is not automated and requires a xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH14_Performance_Tables.adoc#_research_teams[Research Team] of vets and biologists.
The research team rolls are made at the end of the cloning process. 

Shortening the cloning process introduces an new chance of failure.
The cloning process takes 1 day per degree of difficulty.
For example, a 30 DD clone takes 30 days to brew.
If the team decides to speed up the brewing process to 15 days there a 50% (15/30) chance of failure.
The team can try and rescue the speed clone by making another roll at double the degree of difficulty.

Most often a clone brew will fail catastrophically.
The tank will contain a jumbling blob of bones, tubes, organs and rumpled skin.

Machine Failure::
If the cloning process fails there is a 1% chance per DD of the maneuver of the machine breaking down.
So if the degree of difficulty is 20 there is a 20% chance of machine break down.
Jump to xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH21_Artifact_Damage.adoc#_extent_of_damage[Equipment Damage] to see how bad things are.

=== Life Ray 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Power Source
Bonuses:: Nil
Wate:: 1250kg
EXPS:: 10000
Value:: 22100010042

A life ray will resurrect deceased organic tissue into a living state.
Enormous energy surges (like lightning) are used to rehydrate desiccated cells, restore chemical equilibriums, and rebalance biological polarities.
The Life Ray is a machine, and the deceased must be placed within it.

The Life Ray must be employed within 42 hours of death.
The life ray will faithfully restore the body to the from that is presented to it.
The ray does not heal or repair the body.
Any corrective surgery must be completed before the life ray is activated.
For instance a limb would only be reconnected to the regenerated patient only if her arm were properly reconnected before the restoration procedure.

To properly activate the life ray is a veterinarian only maneuver.
The difficulty is 1 DD per hour since death. 
For example, a patient that has been dead for 6 hours would be a DD6 maneuver.
A <<_stasis_bag,Stasis Bag>> arrests the decomposition of death.
With a stasis bag the DD is dependent on how long it took to get the body into the bag.
4 hours after dying would be a 4DD maneuver to operate the life ray.

The life ray is not a healing device. 
The persona will be restored to zero HPS and regain consciousness.
Missing limbs do not grow back. 
Attributes are not restored. 
Pain will continue.

The life ray cannot restore a persona with a zeroed attribute.
So a persona who has zero physical strength is permanently dead.
Charisma is the only attribute that can decrease to zero.

Death leads to decrepitude. 
Every attribute is damaged by the death experience.
A rebooted persona suffers the following attribute penalties.
AWE, CHA, CON, DEX, INT, PSTR and HPS maximum will lose 0 to 3 points (d4-1).
If the persona zeroes one of her attributes during a life ray treatment she is permanently dead.

There is a chance that the death experience will increase a persona's mental strength.
A dead consciousness may develop a stronger link to the thinkspace. 
The first time a life ray reboots a persona her mental strength may jump by 3 points.
The personas adds 0-3 (1d4-1) to MSTR.
Further life ray treatments subject the persona's MSTR to a -1 to +1 (1d-2) attribute adjustment.
Eventually everything succumbs to entropy and dies. 

If any of the persona's attributes fall below one, she is permanently dead.

Once the body is technically restored by the machine, the persona must be brought back to life.

Unless the life ray is employed with precision it can seriously imbalance a campaign.
The premise that all personas who keep dying will eventually die.
If a life ray does not fit into the milieu of the campaign the referee can discard it and have the player roll a different device.

The wrap will heal up to 30 hit points of specific skin damage.

include::ROOT:partial$CH47_Table_Medi_Wrap_Type.adoc[]

A veterinarian can extending a vedi wrap to cover multiple smaller wounds. 
This would allow one vedi wrap to be used multiple times.
This is a flat 3DD maneuver.
Only veterinarians can extend a vedi wrap.

A veterinarian can use a vedi wrap to cover different injury types.
This would allow a chemical burns wrap to be used for a thermal burn.
This a flat 3DD maneuver.
Only veterinarians can cross purpose a vedi wrap.

NOTE: *A vedi wrap is not a veggie wrap and therefore not edible.*

Previous names have included Vedi wraps are also called medi wraps, med packs, veti wraps and first aid wraps.


=== Vedical Kit 

[horizontal]
Duration:: 42 uses.
Bonuses:: +42 emergency rolls
Wate:: 10kg
EXPS:: 2000
Value:: 500000

The vedical kit combines a simple diagnostic computer and pile of medical supplies.
The vedical kit is not an autonomous device and assists personas making quick fixes.
The small diagnostic computer can aid any persona in the proper steps of first aid.
Vets enjoy a +42 bonus on any acute care maneuvers (quick fixes, poison cures, etc.).
Other vocations can use the kit, but do not enjoy any bonuses.
Non-vet personas can apply quick fixes (and only quick fixes) when using a medical kit.
The diagnostic computer runs out of power, and the stores run out of materials, after 42 uses.
Recharging a medical kit is left to the improvisational talents of the referee.

A vedical kit can also been called a medical kit, trauma box or fist aid machine.

Vets, and biologists, can use the metab counter to locate life forms, and to determine their health.


=== Mood Ball 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Unlimited
Bonuses:: +20 in emotion related rolls
Wate:: 2.1kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 25000

The mood ball will alter and maintain the disposition of the persona holding it.
If they are depressed it will make them happy, if they get angry it will calm them down.
The mood ball is a psychiatric device that employs electrical signals and inaudible sounds to maintain socially acceptable personalities from the user.
The mood ball is not a mind control device.
The user is aware that she is employing the ball for her own benefit, since they will be genuinely happier when the ball is activated.

A persona that is frequently subjected to the emotional adjustments of the mood ball may become dependant on the device.
The mood ball cannot be used to negate reasonable emotions, but may make them more tolerable.

When a mood ball is used to manipulate a persona they get a a psionic roll.
Winning the save roll prevents the mood ball from having any emotional effect.

=== Mutation Detector 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Unlimited
Bonuses:: +25 on mutation related rolls
Wate:: 1kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 25000

This handy little box analyzes personas to detect mutations.
There is one light for physical mutations and one light for mental mutations.
This device does not detect the evolved powers of aliens.
If the alien has mutated then the detector will sound off.

If a target has physical and mental mutations both lights sound off.
The detector does not reveal anything about the nature of the mutation.
A mutation detector has a next hex range and does not work through obstructions.

=== Neuro Cap 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Unlimited
Bonuses:: Nil
Wate:: 80gm
EXPS:: 200
Value:: 90000

The cap generates a think space interference that prevents psionic intrusion.
The device looks like an oversized beanie with a blinking light on top.
The neuro cap will not defend against mental attacks that manipulate the environment.
For example cryokinesis and life leech don't pass through the think space to work.
However, ESP, and mental control would be blocked by the neuro cap.

Mental attacks must first win a roll against a the persona's doubled mental strength.
A persona with a 15 MSTR would have a psionic barrier 30.
If the persona's MSTR were 6, her neuro barrier would be 20.
A  Neuro Cap is just a machine, and offers no other benefits to the persona wearing it. 

A mutant must remove a neuro cap before she can unleash her own  mental mutations.
While wearing a neuro cap on she must win a psionic roll versus double her MSTR before using a mental mutation.  

=== Poison Detector 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Unlimited
Bonuses:: +15 on poison related rolls
Wate:: 1kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 25000

This handy little box detects poisonous compounds. 
The poison detector has a 2 hex range.
There are a few lights and a scale.
The scale indicates how dangerous the poison is.
The danger is related to the intensity, but the exact intensity is not revealed.
The detector can also differentiate between radiation, chemical or biologic poisons.

Nomads and biologists can use the device to assess a poison risk.
A vet can use the device to assist with treating toxic patients.

=== Poison Box 

[horizontal]
Duration:: 15 treatments per Battery
Bonuses:: +42 for poison related rolls
Wate:: 20kg
EXPS:: 1984 
Value:: 62036049

A poison box can synthesize an antidote from a sample of a poison. 
If there is no antidote to the poison box acts as a resource for veterinarians. 
The poison box has no range and the toxic sample must be placed into it.
A treatment can be either an antidote or a huge performance roll bonus for the vet.

Synthesis of antidote requires 1 to 8 hours of battery use.
This often means that an initial poisoning will not have an antidote in time.
If an antidote is fabricated future poison rolls will double the persona's constitution.
An antidote or treatment has no effect if the persona is already dead.

Reconfiguring a poison box to make poison is very hard and quite likely will destroy the machine.
This would require a research team and is at least a 50DD maneuver. 
A failed attempt at reconfiguring a poison box for nefarious purposes would destroy it.

=== Psionic Box 

[horizontal]
Duration:: 200 units per Battery
Bonuses:: +42 for psionic related rolls
Wate:: 20kg
EXPS:: 1984
Value:: 129036049

The psionic box is like a stethoscope for the think space.
The device contains materials that absorb psionic energy wavelengths, and frequency generators that can constructively, or destructively interfere with think space wave forms.
The veterinarian can use the psionic box to probe the local area for psionic anomaly.
The box is an elaborate detector that will betray the presence of any mental mutations (but not physical mutations), or manipulations of a psionic nature.
For instance the psionic box could be used to eavesdrop on telepathic conversations, or send out simplistic psionic signals.

If the hair net like extension of the device is attached to the scalp of a suspected mutant, there is a chance of determining what mental mutations the persona has.
Time stop mutation would reveal the ability to manipulate time, and not something called time stop.
If the persona saves versus mental attack of intensity 4 to 24, the psionic box will yield no information.
The level of the veterinarian making the assessment can be added to the intensity, increasing her chances of success.
Such a probe will take 1 to 100 units of melodramatic agony.
This requires a successful maneuver of DD12 for a veterinarian (DD16 for biologists).
If this device happens to be combined with a cerebro converter, the victim's mind can be searched like a roll-a-dex for vital information.

=== Phenotype Detector

[horizontal]
Duration:: Unlimited
Bonuses:: +15 for type related rolls
Wate:: 2.1kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 25000

This handy little box helps detect the taxonomy of organic personas. 
The detector works on deceased specimens as well.

EXP has a sciency fiction taxonomy to separate the three families.
Jump to xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH04__Families.adoc[Families] for more info.
The family level reading will be hominidae (anthros), diversidae (aliens), or inorganic.

The genus level reading for anthros is homo.
The species level reading for anthros is the anthro type.
Anthro types are avis (avarian), Canis (canine), Felis (feline), etcetera.
An aquarian would register as Hominidae Homo Pisces.
It's subspecies would be its appearance shark, goldfish, or octopus.

The genus level reading for alien depends on what the referee named it.
Brand new aliens can be registered and cross referenced to other registered aliens. 
This would allow a biologist to build a menagerie of sciency fiction names.
The famous sand worm from Arrakis would register as Diversidae Lumbricalis Arrakis Gigantis.
Later the sand worm may be renamed Diversidae Lumbricalis Arrakis Melange.
A phenotype detector can add a tremendous amount of work for the referee.

=== Rejuv Chamber 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Power Source
Bonuses:: +42 on healing rolls
Wate:: 333kg
EXPS:: 2000
Value:: 210000042

The rejuv chamber is a technomagical device that repairs damaged organic personas.
This is the classic fluid filled tank where the injured are submerged to heal. 
A deceased persona will only clog up a rejuv chamber. 
This artifact does *not* restore life to the dead and does *not* grow back missing limbs.
The rejuv will remove bullets, replace burned skin, set bones, excise tumours, drain swellings, trephine a skull, fix blood chemistry, filter toxins, and groom the patient's hair, nails and skin.
After a stint in a rejuv chamber the patient will feel refreshed, clean, and alive.
Some personas use the precious device as a personal groomer.

The chamber does *not* resurrect deceased personas.
Nor does the chamber restore missing limbs.
The chamber does restore hit points and attribute values.
The rejuv chamber can repair AWE, CHA CON, DEX, PSTR and HPS.
The rejuv chamber cannot repair INT, MSTR or HPS Max. 
If an attribute is below 1 (except CHA and HPS) the persona is irrevocably dead.

The rejuv chamber robs Peter to pay Paul. 
The chamber spends time moving tissue around to replace and regrow damaged tissue.
There is a good chance that one attribute will be repaired at the expense of another.
To enjoy a clean rejuv chamber experience the vet must make a successful performance roll.
The degree of difficulty of the maneuver is 1 DD per point being rejuvenated.
So repairing 10 HPS would be a 10 DD maneuver. 
xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH14_Performance_Tables.adoc#_research_teams[Research Teams] are recommended when running a rejuv chamber.

Vet failure will result in the removal of one point from one attribute to repair another. 
Regardless of how many hit points are being repaired the attribute only counts as 1 point.
The attribute reduced is randomly determined.
When repairing tissue the rejuv chamber may damage the patient.

Treating parasites, diseases, poisons, tumours, and pharma does not damage the persona.
At full health a persona can get a wonderful manicure and hair doo without risk.

include::ROOT:partial$CH47_Table_Rejuv_Damage.adoc[]

Treatment duration is 1 hour per hit point being rejuvenated or 1 day per attribute being rejuvenated. 
So a persona getting rejuvenated 20 HPS would require 20 hours in the machine.
If the vet lost her 20 DD performance roll the persona would lose 1 point off a random attribute and return to full health. 

Vets can speed up the process by increasing the degree of difficulty of the maneuver.
The rejuv chamber does not work like a stasis bag and ejects personas once treatments are done.

=== Respirator 

[horizontal]
Duration:: 5 hours per Battery
Bonuses:: +15 on breathing rolls
Wate:: 2.5kg
EXPS:: 500
Value:: 50000

A Respirator will monitor, regulate and maintain respiration in organic personas.
This includes any anthro persona physiology.
For example, the respirator moves carbon dioxide for florians. 
The device snuggles over the mouth and nose.
It appears like a full face, rounded scuba mask

If any breathing irregularities arise the respirator will take over. 
The device will filter out toxic substances in the air, but does not have its own air supply.
It protects the persona from toxic air but is not usable underwater.

This artifact can be combined with a <<_cardio_vest,Cardio Vest>> to buy time for personas in cardiopulmonary arrest.

=== Scalpel 

[horizontal]
Duration:: 300 units per Battery
Bonuses:: +15 on fleshy rolls
Wate:: 100gm
EXPS:: 200
Value:: 1500

This scalpel is blade-less finely adjustable surgical flesh cutting device.
A scalpel will easily cut through any organic covering.
Most often it is lazer based, but the scalpel could also be sonic based.
Choose which style is best for the milieu.

Weaponizing this device yields unpredictable results.
Each attack drains 30 units of battery power.
Six attacks would drain a full battery.
It attacks as a type A weapon, but has no PSTR bonus.
A successful attack roll will inflict 2-12 (2d6) hit points of cutting damage.

A treatment with this device used 1-20 units of battery.
Often this artifact is referred to as a lazer scalpel.

=== Stasis Bag 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Single use.
Bonuses:: Nil
Wate:: 300gm
EXPS:: 200
Value:: 1500

The stasis bag is the body bag of the future.
All organic processes are suspended within the bag.
This means that there is no decomposition, no need for respiration, and no need for food.
The stasis bag will suspend any organic material in a steady state: lunches,
bodies, limbs, eyes for the eye bank, and even whole unconscious organisms.
The auto-embalmer cannot hold an unwilling occupant, and anyone could thrash their way out of the thin opaque bag.
Stasis bags can be any colour, but they are always opaque. 

A stasis bag requires an atmosphere and a temperature between 80°C and +80°C.
The bag does not work exatmo, or protect the contents from fire or further damage.

A stasis bag must be properly opened by a vet, biologist or mechanic.
Failing the 5 DD performance roll results in spoiled contents. 
Spoiled contents will be dead, suffer accelerated aromatic decomposition.
Long term storage can lead to explosive spoiling.
This results in a failed stasis bag acting like a grenade of grossness.
A stasis bag has a 1% chance per year of storage of explosive spoiling.
This does not happen if the performance roll is successful.

One bag can hold 150 kg.
Only one type of organic material per bag is allowed. 
Two canines would be acceptable.
A canine and turnips would not.
Larger bags increase in value (+1000 ) and wate (+200 gm) for every additional 150 kg of capacity.

=== Touch Gloves 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Single use.
Bonuses:: +20 for touch related rolls
Wate:: 2gm
EXPS:: 360
Value:: 25000

Touch gloves are medical safety gloves that also enhance the sense of touch.
They appear as surgical gloves with visible circuitry and maybe a blinking light.
When worn they melt into the skin, accentuating the persona's digital sense of touch.
This produces hypersensitive touch of such clarity that the user can almost feel air molecules careening off her fingertips.

The gloves cannot be removed, and wear off in about 1 to 4 days.
Typically a vet will remove the gloves after a maneuver is completed.
The gloves can be scraped off easily with a good paw wash.

Touch gloves improve the persona's awareness. 
There is a general bonus of +1 AWE. 
There is an addition bonus of +2 AWE when making touch related rolls.

There are additional vet and vocation specific bonuses.
The gloves will restore the sense of touch to any persona who is "out of touch."
Mechanics can use the bonus for delicate repairs.
Veterinarians get an additional +15 on all surgery related rolls.
Spies can use the bonus for picking pockets, or opening locks.
Pilots and drivers can use the bonus for driving rolls.

=== Translinker 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Self powered
Bonuses:: +42 with connected device
Wate:: 200gms
EXPS:: 750
Value:: 1000000

The translinker is a bidirectional neuro machine connector.
The translinker will allow a veterinarian to directly interface with a piece of vet equipment controlling it as an extension of her own mind.
The translinker would allow a vet to integrate herself with a rejuv chamber and make medical decisions along the way.
The translinker allows her to visualize the device's data as part of her own memory structure, and to control the device's controls as part of her own motor system.
She becomes at one with whatever she translinks with.

A translinker could also be used by a mercenary to fire a piece of artillery, or by a spie to bypass a security lock, or by a mechanic to drive a space vehicle.
A translinker would allow virtual access to a computer's memory system.
If the persona starts to use the translinker for things other than simple machines (robots or AI computers) there is a very real risk of the machine gathering some control over the persona, or the persona becoming addicted to the sensations of translinking.

The artifact being connected to must have either data or computational power of some kind.
The translinker could not attach to a vedi-kit or a pistol.
But it may connect to a vedical kit or a fancy scope.

The translinker can take on any format that the referee wishes.
One the persona's end there may be a socket in the skull, or it may look like tin foil hat.
The connector could be a cord, radio link, or a keyboard deck.
The device could have a plug or a nail that is driven into the side of the machine.


== Vet Equipment Attribute Explanations

=== Combining Equipment

As veterinarians gather vet equipment their proficiency as healers will increase greatly.
A low level veterinarian could perform the most amazing of miracles.
Because of this some referees will want to limit the amount of equipment that he persona will be able to use at once.
This is entirely the preference of the referee.
A vet could be limited to using 2 pieces of vet equipment per experience level.
If additional pieces are desired then the persona must make a successful PT roll to include them.
Research teams can greatly assist her because each persona can control several artifacts yet all the players rolling will earn PT roll bonuses.

=== Duration 

Duration is the amount of use that can be had from a piece of vet equipment before it must be discarded, or its batteries replaced.
If the duration only has a certain number of uses like One use, or 50 uses, then the device is depleted when that number of uses is reached.
Many devices only require a freshly charged set of batteries, but other devices are disposable, or require replacement materials.
Devices that have a time length like 500 units, or 25 hours
can operate for that length of time before their batteries are depleted.
If a duration lists a wate like 500kgs This means that the device can process 500 kg of flesh, or materials, before the batteries must be replaced.
The last duration type is power source.
This means that ate artifact requires so much power that it must be attached  to an industrial power source, like a nuclear generator, or a hydroelectric power plant.
It is not uncommon for these artifacts to require a cooling down period, or even a maintenance, between uses.

=== Wate 

The wate of medical equipment is the functional wate of the toy excluding batteries.
For some equipment the wate after tech level adjustment is an indicator of how difficult the machine is to use.

=== EXPS 

The experience point value is awarded to the persona who correctly identifies the device, or is successfully treated with the artifact and then identifies it.
Enormous experience point awards are supposed to be granted to entire expeditions, or research teams, not individual personas.

=== Value 

This is the electrum piece value of the device in a regular market, certain devices may be invaluable if a wealthy enough persona's health is on the line.
