= Miscellaneous Weapons

Miscellaneous weapons are the unique technomagical artifacts that do not fit into typical weapon types.
These weapons have bizarre twists that makes them different from the regular bizarre weapons.
Miscellaneous weapons are killing devices, and they are used to deliver injury and death.

=== Arm of Ephro 
[horizontal]
Type:: A
Range:: Adjacent Hex
Damage:: 4-24 (4d6)
Duration:: Until Destroyed
Wate:: 30kg
EXPS:: 820
Value:: 1243941

The arm of ephro is a personal robotic combat machine.
The device appears as a pole with a spiked ball on each end.
The arm befriends a persona, and will join in combat against her enemies.
The arm's only drawback is its tendency to jump the gun, and attack personas whom its owner speaks harshly to, threatens, or dislikes.
Whenever the persona gets angry or raises her voice there is a 2% chance of the arm will go flying into action.
There is no method of communication with this robot. 
It only expresses it's love by attacking the persona's enemies.
During combat the arm fights in front of its owner, and increases her AR by 75.
The arm attacks twice per unit, has an AR of 900, and can move at 10 h/u (via anti-gray).
Unlike other robots this one is destroyed when it reaches 0 HPS,
The arm of ephro will start with 10-100 (10d10) Hit Points.

=== Black Hole 
[horizontal]
Type:: Special
Range:: Adjacent Hex
Damage:: Complete Annihilation
Duration:: 42 Moves per Battery
Wate:: 108 Tonnes
EXPS:: 5700
Value:: 50000000000

The black hole is an unorthodox, but deadly weapon.
When activated appears as a black space.
Anything that wanders within 1 hex of the active black hole is sucked into oblivion.
Any artifacts, personas, projectiles that pass through the field disappear in a spiralling light show. 
While this process is not instantaneous it cannot be stopped and is absolutely final.
Anything lost to a black hole is lost from both time and space, and can never be retrieved.
Pretty serious stuff.

An activated black hole does not suck the air out a room. 
An activated black hole does pull everything within light years towards it.
An activated black holed does not generate darkness beyond it's 1 hex radius.
There is some debate whether this weapon is a black hole at all. 
Maybe it is a really small black hole?
Maybe it is field gravity anomaly that behaves like a black hole?
In this mythos there are few scientists (mechanics) left to study this artifact.
Accidents lead to less and less of them all the time.

The inactivated black hole looks like a spherical backyard three wheeled barbecue. 
The difference is that this barbecue comes with a remote control and has a wate over 100 tonnes.
If found without an active black hole the barbecue is a called a gravulator. 
The gravulator disappears when the black hole is activated and reappears when inactivated.

The gravulator is only way to move the black hole.
The remote control device has a few arrows and an off/on button.
It is definitely an off/on button and not an on/off button. 
The black hole can only be moved when inactivated.
It must be properly, never safely, positioned before being activated.
The remote control for the gravulator can store 5 moves inputted from it's arrows.
The gravulator moves at 2 hu, and can make 42 moves before replacing the battery.

For example, maneuver the black hole via the gravulator up against a wall. When the black hole is activated it will suck in all the elements of the wall touching the black hole. 
It will not suck in the whole wall. 
It will create a black hole sized opening in the wall. 
There is no dust or debris or noise, just a spiral of final light.
Whether the rest of the wall gives off debris, creaks or whines, or collapses is the referee's purvey.
Personas being drawn into the black hole may be very noisy indeed.

If the gravulator loses power, is destroyed or tampered with the black hole will drift away.
The black hole will float away from the planet's gravity at a rate of 1cm per day. 
It will eat all it encounters disappearing in the blackness of space looking for it's friends.

=== Bullet Pen 
[horizontal]
Type:: C
Range:: 20h (-200)
Damage:: 4-24 (4d6)
Duration:: One Shot
Wate:: 0.1 kg
EXPS:: 200
Value:: 700

The bullet pen appears and functions as a normal pen.
It has a steel nib, and an inkwell, and writes very nicely.
However, when the pocket clip is violently drawn back, the ink ignites, firing the steel nib as a lethal projectile.
This pen is mightier than a sword.

=== Compucrafted Weapon 
[horizontal]
Type:: A or B
Range:: Same
Damage:: Special
Duration:: Until Destroyed
Wate:: Special
EXPS:: 500
Value:: Special

The compucrafted weapon is a new and improved version of a mundane weapon type.
Compucrafted weapons are better balanced, better engineered, and use better materials, 
The compucrafted equivalent of a mundane weapon is easier to use and more dangerous. 
Compucrafted weapons have and attack roll bonus of +3-300 (3d100), and a damage bonus of +1-8 (1d8).
Thus a compucrafted sword could have an attack roll bonus of +120, and a damage adjustment bonus of +5.
The compucrafted weapon's wate is half the mundane weapon's wate. 
The wate alteration has no negative effect on the weapon. 
It is still a more potent killing device.
The compucrafted weapon's value is equal to its mundane cost multiplied by its attack roll bonus.

include::ROOT:partial$CH49_Table_Compucrafted.adoc[]

=== Comm Blaster 
[horizontal]
Type:: Special
Range:: 300 h
Damage:: 6-36 (6d6)
Duration:: 3 Uses per Battery
Wate:: 7.4 kg
EXPS:: 700
Value:: 220000

The comm blaster destroys a specific radio transceiver by delivering a pulse of energy.
The target radio explodes like an acoustic fragmentation grenade.
The explosion has a 2 hex radius area of effect.
This counter insurgency artifact is used to destroy active threats, or to dispose of compromised equipment.
The comm blaster does not work on lazer communicators.
Regardless of the communicator size the area of effect damage will be the same, and the radio will be destroyed.
Earpiece or smaller personal comm devices destroyed only harm the wearer and have no area of effect.

=== Cutting Lazer 
[horizontal]
Type:: Special
Range:: 15h (-999)
Damage:: Special
Duration:: 20 Units per Battery
Wate:: 5 kg
EXPS:: 795
Value:: 120000

The cutting lazer is an industrial tool repurposed to destroy robots. 
This robot slayer feared by all synthetics, women in powered armour, and most referees.
The cutting lazer emits a coherent beam of organized light that slices through solid, inorganic matter, like a lazer slices through a vacuum.
The mere twist of a persona's wrist can cut a hex-sized hole in hull metal.
What defense does a referee's scenario have against a cutting lazer (other than organic walls)?
Nothing.

An inventive player can use this artifact to solve most scenarios in a few moments.
The only thing to do is to make the weapon difficult to use.
The cutting lazer has 20 units of power, and every unit it cuts it will use a random 1-12 units worth of this energy reserve.
The lazer cannot cut more than an 8 hex line per unit.
This may be sufficient to complete the job, but when the cutting lazer runs out of power no cutting can be completed that unit.

To be weaponized the cutting lazert must win an attack roll.
A cutting lazer gets a +250 attack roll bonus against inorganic targets.
A successful hit will simply cut something off.
No attack roll is required for sessile inorganic targets.
The damage incurred by inorganics should be at least catastrophic.
A cutting lazer will inflict 100 to 600 (10d6 times 10) HPS of damage to robots per successful hit.

//+++<figure id="attachment_5342" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5342" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i0.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/displacementgloves.5301.png?resize=250%2C185[Getting in before the punch.,250]](https://i0.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/displacementgloves.5301.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5342" class="wp-caption-text">+++Getting in before the punch.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

=== Displacement Gloves 
[horizontal]
Type:: A
Range:: Special
Damage:: 1-4 (1d4)
Duration:: 20 hits per Battery
Wate:: 0.4 kg
EXPS:: 240
Value:: 600

The principal of displacement gloves is very simple.
A force field projects the damaging force ahead of the incoming fist.
The displacement gloves change the range of the striking force after each attack, making it difficult for the target to get familiar with the device.
There is a +150 attack roll bonus for punches offered.
The bonus is due mostly to the target's confusion rather than increased combat skill.

=== Electro Weapon
[horizontal]
Type:: A or B
Range:: Special 
Damage:: Special
Duration:: 30 hits per Battery
Wate:: Plus 0.3 kg
EXPS:: 500
Value:: Plus 900

Electro weapons are non-powered weapons with an added electrical charge.
Electro weapons are also called zappers.
The electro weapon attacks the same as its base weapon type, but the electro weapon has an added kick of +2 to 16 hit points of shock damage.
When the battery charge runs out, an electro weapon can be used as a mundane weapon.

include::ROOT:partial$CH49_Table_Electro.adoc[]

=== Expando Dagger 
[horizontal]
Type:: A
Range:: Nil
Damage:: 4-24 (4d6)
Duration:: Until Destroyed
Wate:: 0.75
EXPS:: 220
Value:: 110

An expando dagger appears as a normal dagger.
The expando mode is activated when a successful attack roll is made.
The expando action fires barbs and hooks into the target's flesh.
This shredding action accounts for why the damage is so much higher than a typical dagger.

A skilled user has two options after the expando barbs are activated. 
The first option to have the barbs retract allowing for another attack in the next unit. 
The second option is to have the dagger permanently stick in the target. 
This second option allows for mild ongoing damage of 1-4 hit points per unit. 
However this damage will not cease until the weapon is removed.
A vet is required to remove it safely. 
The untrained macho act of pulling it out causes additional damage.
Removing the dagger in this fashion will inflict another 4 to 24 hit points of damage.

A poison coated expando dagger increases the intensity of the poison by 4 points locked into the target.

=== Flare Gun 
[horizontal]
Type:: C
Range:: 40h (-999)
Damage:: 2-20 (2d10)
Duration:: Special
Wate:: 0.75 kg
EXPS:: 220
Value:: 110

The flare gun is a pistol shaped survival device that fires a geo-stationary flare into the sky.
The exact height height of the flare is determined by a dial on the flare gun.
The flare can also be directed to an exact location if a successful attack roll is made.
Once aloft the flare is unaffected by normal winds and shines through cloud and rain.
This quickly reveals the expedition's position to potential rescuers.

The flare will light the location until remotely turned off by the flare gun dial. 
Otherwise it will shine indefinitely. 
Space rescue can take a long time to happen.

The flare gun is often weaponized.
While a cumbersome weapon it has it's bright spots.
Flare gun is a single shot weapon. 
It must be reloaded after each shot and can only attacks every other unit.

A successful attack roll inflicts 2-20 (2d10) hit points of damage.
Each hit point of damage indicates a 5% chance the flare will adhere and burn the target.
So a flare that inflicts 10 hit points in damage has a 50% chance on sticking to the target.
While stuck the flare burns brightly both revealing the target and inflicting additional damage.
Each unit that the flare is attached it inflicts and additional 1-6 (1d6) hit points of damage.

The flare is not designed to burn flesh or metal and extinguishes itself in 1-20 units.

=== Geo Drop Disk 
[horizontal]
Type:: Special
Range:: Special
Damage:: 100-1200 (1d12*100)
Duration:: One Use
Wate:: 0.5 kg
EXPS:: 650
Value:: 1500000

The geo drop disk is a targeting device for an exatmo bombardment.
The dense metallic disk may support a few boring lights.
It may be mistaken for a land mine with blinking lights.
When activated the disk becomes the center of an area of attack weapon from outer space.
The geo drop disk calls for and targets a surface strike from an orbiting death dealing device.
The drop disk is has two dials, one for area of effect (0 to 20 hexes) and another for time (0 to 30 units).
Setting both the dials will set the device for action.
Throwing it on the ground will activate the area of effect and time line dialed in. 
Once deployed the geo disk  locks into place and brings down the rain.
The geo disk is locked in place and is unmovable once deployed.

The nature of the attack is up the referee and milieu. 
The mythos may have automated orbiting space stations just waiting for the call. 
Or a low orbit military craft patiently on duty. 
The expedition may never know where or what the attack comes from.

The format of the attack is up to the referee as well.
There may be a wall of tiny pebbles hurtling at terminal velocity, a massive beam of destruction from the sky, a missile strike, or something odder.
Once a giant anvil labeled 16 tonnes crashed onto the geo disk. 


=== Grapple Whip 
[horizontal]
Type:: B
Range:: 1 hex
Damage:: 2-5 (1d4+1)
Duration:: Until Destroyed
Wate:: 0.3 kg
EXPS:: 200
Value:: 400

A grapple whip can be used as a regular whip-cracking damage out with a snap.
With an added twist the grapple whip will tangle itself around the target.
A second to hit roll must be made in order to grapple a target.
The grapple whip leaps from the persona's grasp and starts to crush the grappled target.
The player must make a series of successful attack rolls to keep the whip grappling.
After three successful attack rolls (three units) the whip starts to work on it's own.
Each unit the crushing and cutting of the grapple whip inflicts another 4-24 (4d6) hit points of damage.

The grapple whip will continue to grapple, crush and cut until it finds itself.
This means that until the grapple whip passes through flesh to meet itself it continues to crush.
Even if the target is dead the crushing grapple whip will continue to crush.
A grapple whip continues crushing until the body is diced or a limb is amputated.
This will happen when the whip has crushed for a total of 100 hit points. 
If a persona is still alive after 100 hit points of damage the grapple may have amputated something.
The referee and players can consult xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH36_Hit_Locations.adoc[Hit Locations,window=_blank] to determine what horror transpires.

The grapple whip can only grapple Tiny, Small, and Medium (anthro) sized targets.
A grapple whip can be destroyed by inflicting 100 hit points of damage on it.  


=== Grenade Launcher 
[horizontal]
Type:: C
Range:: 25 h (-200)
Damage:: Special
Duration:: 30 per Battery
Wate:: Special
EXPS:: 350
Value:: 4500

This is a pump activated, magnetically powered grenade launcher.
This device can be mounted on a rifle, or held like a pistol for the same effect.
The wate of the rifle mount is 2 kg, and the paw held pistol is 4 kg.
The grenade launcher can hold 3 grenades at once.
The grenade must have a wate between 0.5 kg and 2.0 kg.
The wate requirement can be less stringent as the grenade launcher increases in tech level.
The grenades are entered unarmed, but they attack as normal grenades when fired.
This weapon is pump activated, and requires batteries to function.

=== Inertia Weapon
[horizontal]
Type:: A or B
Range:: Special
Damage:: 10 + Special
Duration:: 30 per Battery
Wate:: +1.5kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 700

Inertia weapons technomagically increase there inertia the moment they contact a target.
While this increase in wate and force increases damage, it does not improve on attack rolls.
The damage delivered is 3 times the mundane weapons damage plus 10 hit points. 

For example, a sword that inflicts 1-8 (1d8) hit points in damage would inflict 3-24 (3d8).
Then 10 additional hit points plus the persona's Damage Adjustment are added to the total damage.
An inertia weapon that has no power functions the same as it's mundane base weapon.

include::ROOT:partial$CH49_Table_Inertia.adoc[]


=== Lazer Bolo 
[horizontal]
Type:: B
Range:: 2 h per PSTR (-100)
Damage:: 3-38 (3d6)
Duration:: Until Explodes
Wate:: 1 kg
EXPS:: 700
Value:: 1300

The lazer bolo appears like a metallic softball sized sphere that is activated by being thrown.
Once activated the two halves of the sphere separate connected by a crackling lazer line between them.
Activation causes the sphere to separate into to hemispheres.
The hemispheres are connected by a crackling line of lazer light.
The lazer bolo spins through the air at it's target like it's mundane namesake.

A successful attack roll inflicts 3-18 (3d6) hit points of damage.
There is a 5% chance per point of damage that the bolo will explode.
A bolo that sacrifices itself by exploding inflicts an extra 5-30 (5d6) HPS of damage.
If the bolo does not explode there is a 5% chance per point of damage that the bolo will tangle and trip the target. 
The bolo can explode on any sized target, but can only trip up medium, small and tiny personas.

If the bolo does not explode and does not tangle the target it snaps back into a ball and must cool for 3 units.
On occasion a bolo fight will emerge where personas and referee personas throw the same bolo back and forth at each other.

=== Lite Sabre
[horizontal]
Type:: A
Range:: Nil
Damage:: Special
Duration:: Until Destroyed
Wate:: 1.2kg
EXPS:: 700
Value:: Special

A lite sabre is energy sword which can be retracted back into it's hilt.
There are three different kinds of lite sabre, each having its own damage, duration, and value.
The three types of lite swords refer to the nature of the energy blade. 
This weapons hilt is solid, and often quite stylish.
Clear and shimmering energy swords are typical energy weapons turn on and off
Solid beam lite sabers are ancient artifacts that are in tune with Kirlian energy and are the preferred weapon of knites and anti-knites. 
If the expedition has a knite persona it would be assumed that this artifact would automatically be a solid beam lite saber.
To not do so would be simply mean spirited. 

include::ROOT:partial$CH49_Table_Lite_Sabre_Type.adoc[]

If you need a random colour for the lite sabre then jump to xref:iv-software:CH55_Appearances.adoc#_colour_your_whirled[Colour,window=_blank].

Clear::
A clear beamed lite sabre is more a force field club than a cutting lazer sword.
A successful attack roll inflicts 2-12 hit points of damage. 
A clear lite saber does not allow for amputation attacks.
While the beam is clear it is visible to the naked eye and cold to the touch.
Placing one's digits in the activated energy field will not injure the curious persona.
The clear lite sabre is valued at 10000.

Shimmering::
A shimmering beam lite sabre has a super heated energy field flickering from it's hilt. 
A successful attack roll inflicts 4-24 (4d6) hit points.
The beam is dangerous and this weapon can be used by a knite to amputate limbs.
The shimmering saber is *not* connected to kirlian energy and is not a focus tool like the solid saber. 
The beam is less organized and looks like a smokeless flaming sword and only tiny licks of flame.
The best description of the shimmering lite saber is that the beam of lite appears "indecisive."
Placing one's digits on the blade of a shimmering lite saber will burn and injure the curious persona
The shimmering lite saber is valued at 100000

Solid::
The solid beam lite sabre has a contained beam of cutting lazer light emitting from it's hilt.
A successful attack roll inflicts 4-24 (4d6) hit points of damage.
The beam is dangerous and this weapon can be used by a knite to amputate limbs.
The beam looks like a solid blade of light and gives of a glow that matches it's colour.
Placing one's digits on the blade of a solid lite saber will amputate them
The shimmering lite saber is valued at 1000000.

.*Amputation*
The Solid beam lite saber can be used to amputate body parts by a mercenary or knite.
There is a 1% chance per point of damage of an amputating attack.
The amputating attack does no additional damage. 
The limb is nicely cauterized, as is the stump. 
This attack can cut off a tentacle, mechanical arm, or hoof equally easily.
If amputation capability of the is being employed the referee will need to be familiar with xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH36_Hit_Locations.adoc[Hit Locations,window=_blank] 

The knite ability of amputation with lite sabre is in addition to the regular solid beam sabre's chance of amputation.


.*Kirlian Mythos*
The solid lite saber is the true kirlian knite's weapon.
The xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH08_Vocations_Knite.adoc[Knite,window=_blank] is a vocation of mystical mercenaries that choose to fight for chaos or order.
The knite may be a paladin with a flaming sword or sciency fiction evil man in black tights.
Mythical light sabers are of unknown age, and of limited number.
For a knite the lite saber is not just a weapon, but a focus talisman.
The details of how a knite is helped by her light saber is detailed in xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH08_Vocations_Knite.adoc[Knites,window=_blank].

Any solid beam lite sabre will have been previously owned by either a knite or anti-knite.
This means it will be imbued with either kirlian energy of chaos or order.
In short a light saber will be either a knite saber or an anti-knite saber.
When a knite touches a light saber this residual kirlian energy flows through the persona.
If the pathways of the knite and saber match the persona receives an EXPS reward of 1-1000.
If the pathways of the knite and saber are divergent the persona receives an EXPS *penalty* of 1-1000.
Touching a divergent light saber is painful, dramatic and may have consequences.
If the persona is a neophyte and her EXPS is drops below zero, she will switch to the side of the light saber. 

The other light sabers have a value attached to them.
If the kirlian mythos makes this a tool of the knites it is considered a priceless artifact.


=== Mash Net 
[horizontal]
Type:: B
Range:: 3 h (-999)
Damage:: 2-20 (2d10) per unit
Duration:: Until Destroyed
Wate:: 3 kg
EXPS:: 350
Value:: 700

The mash net functions like a regular net when used as shielding.
When thrown as an attack weapon the mash net will tangle up the target.
The more the target struggles the tighter the mash net gets. 
Each unit of struggle will inflict 2-20 (2d10) hit points of crushing and cutting damage.
If the target remains motionless and does not struggle they will not take any crushing damage.
Personas like flora or fauna may panic and struggle until killed by the mash net.

The net can be removed by intense cooling.

=== POV Canon 
[horizontal]
Type:: C
Range:: 15h (-333)
Damage:: 1-4 (1d4)
Duration:: 6 per Battery
Wate:: 4.2 kg
EXPS:: 869
Value:: 245000

The POV Canon (pronounced paw-vee) inflicts minimal physical damage and massive mental transformation.
A successful attack roll has two components: damage, and a powerful wave of compassionate transference.
The target will take 1-4 (1d4) hit points of damage and a psionic attack of intensity 1-10 (1d10) plus the attackers MSTR.
If the target loses the mental attack roll she suffers an intense, but temporary, change of mind. 
The target's point of view switches to a deep, often debilitating, understanding of the attacker's point of view.
The persona immediately adopts a complete understanding of the attacker's emotional and personal position.
The results of this are temporary, lasting one unit per point of intensity of the attack.

This weapon can be used in combat to neutralize threats who suddenly have the same emotional content as the attacker.
So a space trooper adorned in plastix armour may suddenly stop attacking the expedition.
In rare occasions the target may suddenly start to assist the attack with the POV Canon.
Most of the time the target will sit perplexed and deeply contemplative possessed by thoughts other than the immediate battle.
There is a 1 in 1000 (42 on 1d1000) chance that the target may convert to follow the attacker due to their new found complete understanding.

If flora or fauna are subjected to this attack they will writhe in agony unable to understand this new canon.

The POV Shooter can also be an excellent negotiation or interrogation tool.
Giving vets and spies +24 when negotiating with a target.
The POV Canon cannot be used stealthily as it inflicts damage along with the point of view change.

=== Rocket Assisted Weapons 
[horizontal]
Type:: B
Range:: Tripled
Damage:: Doubled + 15 
Duration:: One Use
Wate:: 4 times
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 10 times

Rocket assisted weapons are formerly mundane non-powered missile weapons with rocket assist.
The arrows, boomerangs, and daggers are assisted with micro boosters that increase speed and range. 
Until the boosters kick in the weapons are indistinguishable from their mundane counterparts.
The boosters are activated when launched, and the rocket weapon screams into action.
Rocket assisted weapons are launched as normal Type B weapons, but the booster rockets triple their range, and increase their damage (15 + 2 times damage).

=== Rocket Launcher 
[horizontal]
Type:: C
Range:: 75h (-100)
Damage:: 6-60 (6d10)
Duration:: 1-4 (1d4) Magazine
Wate:: 5 kgs
EXPS:: 500
Value:: 6000

The rocket launcher is a shoulder-mount directing tube that unleashes a tactical micro missile.
The rocket is an area of effect attack damaging to everything in a 3 hex radius of effect.
The firer need only choose a target hex, which makes targeting this weapon simple.
To hit a target hex requires an attack roll higher 600.
The armour rating of the targets does not apply.
Fellow personas caught in this area of effect also take damage.

Sometimes a player wishes to fire the rocket directly at a persona.
The player must score a successful attack roll against the target's armour rating.
There is no area of effect blast, but the target takes triple damage.
This is classic action movie vengeance rocket attack stuff.
A miss will usually indicated the rocket does no damage.

Indoor use of a rocket launcher is an off label use.
The path of the rocket's 75h range is usually interrupted by a wall.
The area of effect blast is measured from that hex.

The rocket launcher can hold 1-4 (1d4) rockets at once.
This would be similar to a magazine of rockets.
A rocket launcher with a 3 missile magazine can fire three times before having to reload.

The rocket launcher will malfunction with a kilodie roll of 42. 
A malfunction usually indicates a dud rocket.
But occasionally an in tube premature rocket explosion is possible.

The mundane version of the rocket launcher has a tube site and shrapnel warheads.
When generating this artifact check for exotic warheads and delivery types.

.*Exotic Warhead*
There is a 20% chance that this rocket launcher has an exotic warhead.
This means that the warhead will be fabricated after a grenade type. 
The grenade area of effect, damage and special effects replace the mundane missile.
Jump to the xref:iii-hardware:CH45_Grenades.adoc#_grenade_type[Grenade Type,window=_blank] to determine the exotic warhead.
The value of the grenade is added to the value of the rocket launcher.

.*Exotic Delivery Type*
There is a 42% chance the rocket launcher has an exotic delivery type.
This means that the missile is not merely delivered by expanding gases.

Autostrike::
A special targeting sight allows the firer to attack at solitary targets with ease.
The armour rating of the target persona is reduced to 600. 
Essentially making the target as easy to hit as an empty hex.
The player does not have to make an attack roll to hit a target hex.
Direct hits inflict triple damage and have no area of effect damage
Autostrike increases the value of the rocket launcher by 5000000.

Crawl::
The targeting system is used by the persona to identify the target location.
When fired the missile leaps out of the rocket tube and crawls along the ground.
The missile can be rocket propelled, on treads, or wheels.
The crawling rocket moves at +25 h/u.  
Crawling missiles are expert at evading detection and anti-missile systems.
This attack acts as an ambush attack.
An attack roll must still be successful. 
The attack roll can be made at the beginning or the ending of the crawl.
The rocket launcher can also be fired normally.
Crawl increases the value of the rocket launcher by 1000000.

Decoy::
Every rocket launched from the tube is accompanied by decoys.
Each rocket will be joined by 1-3 (1d3) mostly harmless decoy rockets.
The number of decoys is determined once and remains the same every attack.
The decoys are identical in appearance and speed.
The decoys will reduce the effectiveness of anti-missile defences.
In the case of anti-missile devices the player gets +100 on the attack roll per decoy.
There are no attack roll bonuses if there is no anti-missile defences.
There is confusion as there is more than one incoming missile.
The rocket launcher can also be fired normally.
Each decoy increases the value of the rocket launcher by 100000.

Delay::
The targeting system is used by the persona to identify a target location.
When fired the missile slowly exits the rocket tube and heads off in a random direction.
The rocket takes a leisurely safe course and cannot be intercepted by anti-missile defences.
This rocket can only be used on stationery targets and direct persona hits are not possible. 
The rocket arrives 2-20 units after being launched.
An attack roll is still required to hit the target hex.
The rocket launcher can also be fired normally.
The delayed arrival rocket increases the rocket launcher value but 100000.

Memory::
The targeting system is used by the persona to identify a specific target.
The rocket launcher will remember this location and the rocket will find it later.
This can be much later. 
The rocket can travel up to 100 kilometers to relocate and explode on a stationery target.
Mobile targets will be chased by the rocket for up to 10 days.
When fired the rocket will go around corners, up stairs, and even wait for an elevator to relocate it's target.
This rocket cannot travel through exatmo, or take public transit.
Attack roll is still required when the rocket lands. 
The rocket launcher can also be fired normally,
The memory rocket increases the value of the rocket launcher by 10000000.

Passenger::
This rocket launcher has a cargo bay that can carry a 1.5 kg passenger.
The passenger can be protected landing the cargo safely on the target hex.
Often the passenger will be a grenade that is rigged to detonate on arrival.
Rigging a grenade on a passenger rocket is a DD2 mechanic, or a DD12 mercenary, maneuver.
The rocket launcher can be fired normally.
The passenger delivery system increases the value of the rocket launcher by 50000.

Vehicle:: 
The targeting system for this rocket launcher compensates for vehicular combat.
There are no penalties when firing from a vehicle at any speed.
The missile can also lock onto a vehicle chasing it down at supersonic speed.
The missile will take 0-3 units to catch up with a targeted vehicle.
A successful attack roll is still required. 
Vehicle compensations increase the value of the rocket launcher by 200000.

=== Spinning Wheel of Death 
[horizontal]
Type:: B
Range:: 150h (-999)
Damage:: Special
Duration:: Reusable Self Powered
Wate:: 25kg
EXPS:: 500
Value:: 32000

The spinning wheel of death is a hand cranked flying wheel that brings serrated death from above.
In it's inactive state the wheel looks like a small table sporting a crank and an oversized spin top.
The top is enormous and does not look like a toy.  
The top is covered in razor sharp slats arranged like vertical venetian blinds.
The stem of the top sits beneath the table and is covered with needles and barbs.
Feverishly cranking the artifact for 4 units automatically activates it.

Once activated it flies straight up into the air and hovers for a moment while it picks it's target.
The spinning wheel of death will select a random organic persona that is in front of table.
The front of the table is the non-crank side.
The wheel does not discern between player personas and referee personas. 
If there is and paucity of targets the wheel could come back for the persona that launched it.
Once this is determined the wheel hurtles in for the kill.
It is presumed that the device homes in using a combination of heat and movement detectors. 

Less relevant referee personas are automatically hit by the wheel.
This means that flora, fauna, and other cannon fodder require no attack roll to be hit.
Player personas and relevant referee personas require an attack to roll to inflict damage.
The player makes an attack roll with a +200 bonus to hit the target (possibly their own persona).

Damage from the spinning wheel of death is excessive.
The gnarly stem pins the target and starts to grind it's way into the flesh.
The stem burrows for 0-3 (1d4-1) units, inflicting 4-40 (4d10) hit points of damage each unit.
Then the main body of the top (venetian blind razor slats) hits the target.
This delivers an additional 10-100 (10d10) hit points of damage.

Once all damage is delivered the wheel can be recovered, cleaned off and used again.
Hit location makes no difference to the damage.
There is no save. 
The spinning wheel of death first appeared in a late night community cable tv comedy show. 


=== Stun Weapons 
[horizontal]
Type:: A or B
Range:: Special
Damage:: Special
Duration:: 15 per Battery
Wate:: + 0.3kg
EXPS:: 250
Value:: 2000

Stun weapons are complicated artifacts render targets stunned and incapacitated.
These are the less lethal weapons of choice for pacifists or kidnappers.
A benign force field ensures the target receives no damaging forces.
The energy that would have damaged the target is converted into nervous system attack.
The neural shock is capable of stunning the target.
The player rolls damage as she would for the weapon's attack.
Instead of delivering damage this is the intensity of the stun attack.
For example, instead of taking 13 hit points in damage the target gets hit with  an intensity 13 stun attack.
This process is repeated every unit until the target is stunned.
Failing the roll leaves the target stunned for 1-4 (1d4) minutes. 
Inorganic personas take damage from the electrical nature of the attack, but cannot be stunned.

The stun weapons are modified mundane non-powered weapons. 
There is also a chance that the power of stun is built into a pair of gauntlets.

include::ROOT:partial$CH49_Table_Stun.adoc[]

The stun gauntlets appear as bulky glowing gloves.
The intensity is calculated by the damage a punch would deliver. 
A punch inflicts -1 to 2 (1d4-2) hit points of damage plus physical strength.
The harder the hit the more energy to stun.

Type A weapons, non-powered thrusting an striking weapons can have the stun deactivated and be used as normal mundane weapons. 
Type B weapons, non-powered projectile weapons can only be used as stun weapons. 

NOTE: *The intensity of stun based on damage has not been tested in an actual game. There is a good chance that the intensity will need to be increased.*


=== Transmogrifier 
[horizontal]
Type:: C
Range:: 15h (-666)
Damage:: Special
Duration:: 5 per Battery
Wate:: 42 kg
EXPS:: 566
Value:: 325000

The transmogrifier converts the diverse matter into a homogeneous solid block.
The artifact appears as a box with a giant overly dramatic lever on top.
Pulling the lever activates the weapon

The transmogrifier is loosely aimed at a target and an attack roll is made.
If the attack roll is successful the persona (alien, anthro, or robot) must save versus poison or be turned into a statue.
The attack roll must be made even if the persona is willing to be transmogrified.
The intensity of the poison attack is 3-24 (3d8). 
If player fails the poison roll the persona is transmogrified into a solid block.
The player must fail the poison even if the persona is willing to be transmogrified.

Transmogrification does not freeze the persona, it transforms her into a 1 to 1 scale statue of themselves.
The Hollywood version of the device blows the personas equipment and armour off their body leaving a naked detailed statue.
The Disney version of the device transmogrifies the persona's equipment and clothing as well. 
No damage is delivered when the persona transmogrifies into a statue.

A failed attack roll has not effect on the target.
If the persona is hit, but avoids transmogrification by winning a save roll she is damaged.
Failed transmogrification inflicts 3-18 (3d6) hit points of damage.
If the persona is turned into a statue no damage is taken.

Transmogrification can be reversed, returning the persona to her previous start.
The artifact is loosely pointed at the statue and the overly dramatic lever is pulled.
Reverse transmogrification inflicts 2-12 (2d6) hit points of damage.

Typically this device is used as a weapon by freezing combatants out of the fight.
The process can also be used to freeze personas for their own protection.
The statues are protected from poison, radiation and the vacuum of space.
Voluntary transmogrification can be used for long haul stasis, or to hide in a museum.

The statues must be treated with reasonable care.
They are not indestructible.
If a limb is broken off a statue that limb is missing when reversed.
If the statue is destroyed the persona is dead.
If numbers are needed a statue will have 1000 hit points.
The statue has no armour rating and is defenseless against chisels or hammers.



=== Temporal Disrupter 
[horizontal]
Type:: C
Range:: 20h (-100)
Damage:: Special
Duration:: 7 per Battery
Wate:: 4 kg
EXPS:: 475 
Value:: 542000

The temporal disrupter is a chrono accelerator that instant aging on targets.
A successful attack roll ages the target 3-36 (3d12) years.
The target takes 1 hit point in damage per year aged.
This damage is inflicted on inorganic and organic personas.
The years are instantly added to the persona's age.
The aging is permanent, and aging effects are instantly applied.
Aliens with short life spans may instantly die.
Anthros may lose some attribute points but gain others. 
Artifacts will appear more shabby and take the hit point damage as well. 

For more info about temporal attacks jump to xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH13_Health.adoc#_aging[Aging,window=_blank].

A malfunction will this weapon will age everything in a 1 hex radius 3 to 36 years.

=== Toss Garotte 
[horizontal]
Type:: B
Range:: 25h (-170)
Damage:: Special
Duration:: Reusable
Wate:: 0.25 kg
EXPS:: 290
Value:: 5000

The toss garotte is a hideous memory metal murder weapon.
It looks a lot like a pie-plate without a center.
The opening fits any anthro sized head.
The weapon is placed over the head in a surprise attack.
It can also be tossed at a target.
The toss garotte sails quite nicely.

To place the garotte directly over a target's head requires both successful ambush and a successful attack roll. 
For the finer points on ambush check out the xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH34_Ambush.adoc[Ambush,window=_blank] rules. 

If the weapon is being tossed at a target the player must win an attack roll.
A successful attack roll doesn't mean has neatly sailed over the target's head.
There are a variety of possible outcomes. 
The garotte may have looped around a leg, over an arm, or around the neck.
An anthro torso is unaffected by this attack, but a tiny or small torso could be ensnared in the garotte.
The xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH36_Hit_Locations.adoc[Hit Locations,window=_blank] system is used to determine what the garotte has grabbed on to.

The garotte instantly tightens inflicting 2-8 (2d8) hit points of damage per unit.
The garotte will amputate an appendage after 1-4 (1d4) units of crushing.

If placed around an anthro neck the persona is unconscious in 1-4 (1d4) units. 
A garotte will not decapitate and unconscious persona.
If the persona is killed by the damage inflicted to neck it is assumed they were decapitated. 

The toss garotte cannot be freed by force rolls since it quickly cuts into the skin.
Remaining completely still and cooling the garotte can stop it's constriction. 
The garotte can withstand 30 hit points in damage before breaking.
Any damage taken by the garotte will also be taken by the victim.


=== Vibro Weapon
[horizontal]
Type:: A 
Range:: Nil
Damage:: +20 damage
Duration:: 25 per Battery
Wate:: +1.3kg
EXPS:: 500
Value:: 5000

Vibro weapons are non-powered thrusting and striking weapons which have been powered to vibrate at cutting frequencies.
This aids both their ability to score a hit and to inflict damage.
Vibro weapons earn +100 on an attack roll, and get +20 hit points to a damage roll.

Jump to the xref:iii-hardware:CH49_Misc_Weapons.adoc#_type_a_weapons[Type A Weapon,window=_blank] to see which mundane weapon is being vibrated.


=== Web Gun 
[horizontal]
Type:: C
Range:: 20h (-100)

The web gun is a glue sprayer with a 1 hex area of effect.
A successful attack roll stop the target in her tracks.
The target will be incapacitated by gluing her down to the ground, or by gluing all her limbs together.
The web gun will work on any target less than 750 kg in wate.

The fine threaded glue will remains sticky for 0-3 (1d4-1) units.
Anything passing through the webbed hex, or touching the webbed target, before the web has set will also get entangled.
Once the web is set and hardened the target is wrapped in a nice cocoon.
Once trapped in a cocoon only outside help may free the victim.
Chiselling, acid, or cutters will make short work of the web, but the persona can't move to free herself.
Saliva can loosen the web just enough to breath.

=== Whammer 
[horizontal]
Type:: B
Range:: 35h (-100) 
Damage:: 3-36 (3d12)

The lazer frisbee will return to its charger after each attack
The whammer will return in 0 to 3 units after each throw.
The whammer is charged by the throwing action.
Trying to catch a whammer counts as an automatic hit on the persona trying to catch it.


== Miscellaneous Weapon Attribute Explanations

=== Type 
The refers to the attack type of the miscellaneous weapon.
Jump here for the gory details of xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH28_Weapons.adoc[Attack Types,window=_blank]

include::ROOT:partial$CH28_Table_Attack_Types_Intro.adoc[]

=== Range 
The range is the effective range of the weapon.
This does not reflect the skills of the persona in any way.
The weapon's range is limited by wavering bullets, dissipating charges, or decaying material.

A typical range is listed as 120h (-230).
The weapon has no attack roll penalties up to 120 hexes.
Beyond that there is an attack roll penalty of -230 per hex beyond that range.
This weapon would have -230 penalty at 121 hexes, and -460 at 122 hexes.
Some weapons have a -1000 penalty for any distance beyond their range.
This means that the attack literally stops at that distance.
Theatrical combat has no range penalties, and any range effects are optional.

=== Damage 
The damage is the range of hit points that can be removed from a target when the weapon scores a hit.
Type C weapons get no PSTR damage adjustment.

=== Duration 
Duration is the amount of use that the miscellaneous weapon can withstand before its battery charge is depleted.
The duration will either indicate the number of units that the device can be used for, or the number of uses, before the batteries must be replaced.

=== Wate 
The wate is simply the wate of the weapon in kilograms, excluding batteries.
This value is added to the persona's wate allowance if she decides to carry the weapon.

=== EXPS 
This is the amount of experience points awarded to the user of the weapon, or whoever else, identifies the weapon's nature.
See chapter 15 in the rule book, Experience, for more info.

=== Value 
This is the value of the weapon, if it should ever be sold, or appraised.
There is no guarantee that a miscellaneous weapon will be sold for its correct worth.
The weapon value is not just a monetary measure, but a measure of the weapons worth relative to other artifacts.

=== Accessory Tables
