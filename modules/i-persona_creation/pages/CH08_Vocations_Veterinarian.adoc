Vets (or Veterinarians) are a combination doctor, homeopath, surgeon, paramedic, and faith-healer.
They are called vets instead of doctors, shaman, or whatever because they are trained to heal the diverse families found in EXP.
They can utilize whatever odds and ends they may know about the base families to implement a temporary or permanent, sometimes incompetent and often miraculous cure.

Veterinarians have at their disposal millennia of medical science's discoveries and accomplishments.
Hence, what may appear as faith healing to the ignorant peasants (of which there are many), may actually be sound medical practice.
A good example of a vet is Bones (Star Trek) and Crusher (Next Generation).

*Vet Conduct*: Vets must strictly adhere to certain goals of class conduct.
In general, they cannot employ any weapon which will cause people (all base families) to come to harm, although the use of other, harmless weapons is admissible.
They cannot initiate violent combat, though they are permitted to take up arms in self-defense.
Ideally, vets are altruistic people-lovers who will avoid killing the proverbial insectoid.
Realistically, vets are at least required to make an effort to avoid wanton bloodthirstiness.

Indeed, repeated displays about violent nature are bound to have adverse effects on the morale of personas about to be treated by the vet.
It is understandably difficult to muster the courage and faith to trust a doctor that has just hurled a hand grenade into a crowded room.
Vets may also be responsible (and this is up to the ref) to certain guilds or associations which may frown upon such violent action.
The simple fact is that vets are a non-combat class and engaging in combat threatens directly tied to function as vets.

*Comatose vs.
Unconscious*: Players must remember that very few of their refs will hold medical degrees and the actual DDs of various medical procedures are subject to the arbitrary, perhaps inaccurate, discretion of the ref.
In the hopes of avoiding some confusion, the difference between (in game terms), coma and unconsciousness will be covered here.

Any persona whose hit point total is below zero is comatose.
They&#8217;re completely devoid of any physical (voluntary or otherwise) action and will die without medical attention.
A persona with a non-negative hit point total may also be immobilized.
This condition is not due solely to the number of HPS the persona has but due to circumstance: damage system shock, knockout gas, blow to the head, etc.
Eventually these unconscious personas will regain consciousness.
Refer to constitution in http://expgame.com/?page_id=48[Chapter 3: Attributes] or http://expgame.com/?page_id=267[Chapter 13: Health].

*Veterinarian Abilities*: The medical skills employed by vets have been picked up from a variety of sources: the local shaman, old husband&#8217;s tales, first aid kit manuals, band-aid boxes, and good old trial and error.
The performance table Degree of Difficulty list should give some idea of how to handle certain situations although the persona will need to be innovative in dealing with unusual circumstances.
There are several &#8220;skills&#8221;
or talents that all vets have which require some explanation.
These are described below.

*Quick Fixes (DD varies)*: This skill can repair personas physical damage.
The medical attention is reflected in returning HPS to a damaged persona.
If the PT roll for a 5% quick fix is successful, the patient will get 5% of her maximum hit points added to her current total.
Thus, a play with max HPS of 30 would get "`healed`" for 2 HPS.

Before more in-depth quick fixes can be attempted (10%, 15%, and 20%), the lower ones must be successful.
No more than four listed quick fixes can be attempted.
How often a vet can do this is up to the ref;
however, the persona should not be receiving healing (recovering HPS) more than once a day.
Conscientious players will record the values of 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% of their HPS max on their persona record sheets in order to speed up the play of the game.

*Subliminal Suggestion (MSTR / 2 DD)*: Words can be popped into the minds of unsuspecting victims.
Simple commands such as "`Don't jump`", "`Wait`", and "`Give it`" may be forced upon the victim.
The more reasonable the suggestion, the more likely that it will succeed.
There is no save versus a successful PT roll.

*Paralyzing Pinch (CON/2 DD)*: The vet applies a crushing grasp to essential vessels and nerves located in the neck.
The grip must be held for 0-2 units and a successful PT roll made at the end of the required time.
The vet must first make a successful two hit roll on an unwilling target.
If successful, the victim is completely immobilized for 1 minute;
if not, the vet is left standing there holding onto the persona's neck.
This can be used as a non-pharmaceutical anesthetic by the veterinarian.
If the PT roll is successful, the target receives no saving throw.

*Death Pinch (CON + d8 DD)*: This is the more deadly version of the paralyzing pinch.
If the crushing grasp is successful, it will leave the victim with a negative hit point total.
How far below zero the victim is depends on the ref and on the vet's level.
The vet must score in two hit roll on unwilling victims and maintain a neck hold for 0-2 units.
It would have to be very drastic circumstances for the vet to have to use this terrible ability.

*Veterinarian Skills*: Veterinarians can specialize in certain areas of their profession and the specializations will offer DD bonuses when PT rolls related to these skills are carried out.
For instance, a veterinarian with emergency medicine 3 would subtract 3 DD from her PT Roll when attempting quick fixes or attempting to stabilize a comatose persona.

*Vet Experience*: Vets gain experience for successful executing of their medical functions as determined by rolls on their performance table.
They earn 70 EXPs per DD.
Since vets are a non-combat class, they may only receive 10% of combat experience.
Gaining experience allows for an increase of experience levels.
The higher the experience level, the better chance the vet has of having a successful practice in a fashionable part of the universe.
