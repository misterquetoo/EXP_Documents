# EXP The game of technological chaos. 

Another attempt at asciidoc markdown static site.
This time using Antora.
While the concept of a static site generator is exciting and attractive execution proves very challenging.
Previous attempts were with Bolt, Grav, Hugo, Jekyll, and a few others. 
Antora is the one that leaves the documents the most pure. 
Pure as in I can use them anywhere else. 
Additionally the community around Antora is nascent and kind.

## What is EXP?

EXP: The Game of Technological Chaos is a paper and dice science fantasy role playing game. 
It is *not* a POV shooter video game, movie, or app. 
You play EXP with dice and real people all sitting in the same room. 

This repository is the rule set for a science fantasy role playing game. 

## Why put an RPG in a repository?

EXP has already been published on the web using a creative commons license.

As the sole author of this text I have craved for version control. 
There are many benifits of storing a rule set in asciidoc on git.

* Version Control
* Sharing 
* Forking
* Docs as Code

## Goals

*Make the world a bit less worse by people playing games together.* 


### Personal goals
