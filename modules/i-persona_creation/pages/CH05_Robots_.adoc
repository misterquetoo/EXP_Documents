= Robots

Robots are the colloquial name for the family Machinae. 
Machinae are any life form that is inorganic and fabricated.
An organic fabricated life form would be an alien.
An inorganic non-fabricated would most likely be an alien.
Robots can be fabricated by Anthros, Aliens or other Robots.
It is possible for robots to be self replicating, but there would always be an original source.

Normal robots are not player personas.
Functioning robots follow commands and have no free will.
A functioning robot may be smart and sentient but it does not have consciousness.
Player persona robots are malfunctioning robots.
They have sentience, free will and consciousness.
From a robotic standpoint they are broken.

Robots are for players who want to try something different and challenging.
Robots are a challenging persona type because there is no organic frame of reference.
They have not basic humanoid form.
A robot may have wheels instead of legs.
A robot may have no appendages to manipulating artifacts.
Many actions a player expects her persona to carry out will not be possible with a robot.
The shape and lack of appendages makes robots more alien than aliens.

.Robots may work for you if
* You have a strong affinity for things mechanical.
* You have rapport with your computer, toaster or electric drill.
* You don't mind your persona never picking up an artifact.

If you are still here creating a robot player persona welcome aboard.
Robots are very mechanistic in their creation.
To ensure campaign balance the player has very few decisions in how the robot is generated.

.There are no robot storks.

== Attributes
Robots have the usual seven attributes. 
This includes AWE, CHA, CON, DEX, INT, MSTR, PSTR and HPS.
However the generation of these attributes is unique to robots.
There are four prime requisites:  CON, DEX, INT and PSTR.
The prime attributes determine the robotic type as well as her attributes.

Robot Control Factor determines whether a robot maintains its free will.
Fabricator Type may keep a robot from doing where her persona wants.
Neither is an attribute, but both are crucial to a robot persona.

Robots do not engage in the organic think space at all.
Robots have a MSTR of 0. 
Robots also do not have a social standing. 
If robots need to compare their privilege they would use their value.

=== Determining Prime Attributes
The player first generates the prime attributes.
The prime attributes are CON, DEX, INT and PSTR.
Each prime attribute is determined by rolling 1d4.
This value is called the level of the prime attribute.
Each prime attribute is recorded on the persona record.

A player that rolls a three for prime PSTR thus has a PSTR level of 3.
The true value of the attribute is generated from the attribute level.
The attribute level determines the robot type of the persona.
Attributes can change through out the game, attribute levels do not change.
The persona will  have four prime attribute each with a levels between one and four.
For example a CON level of 2, a DEX level of 2, an INT level of 3 and a PSTR level of 4.

=== Regular Attributes
Attributes amongst the families are equal in value. 
An INT 12 is equal amongst robots, aliens and anthros.
Prime attributes must be converted into regular attributes.
The prime attribute must remain on the persona record sheet.
For example INT would be recorded as INT level 2 INT 12.

Both the CON level and regular CON are recorded on the persona record.

// robot  assembly  Anthros building robots to replace anthros

== Robot Type
The player uses her robotic attribute levels to determine her robot persona type.
Determining robot type is byzantine, meticulous and painful.
This is why https://github.com/misterquetoo/EXP_Game_Tools[EXP Game Tools] were developed.
The game play reason for this challenging system is needed because robots are not balanced in power.
A heavy offensive combot is a force that cannot be reckoned with. 
In EXP personas are randomly generated.
Therefore extremely powerful robot types are rare.
If a player were playing a robot that could destroy an entire city she would likely be the center of the campaign.

TIP: Rules maintain game balance and assist creativity. +
*Do not let rules get in the way of the story or the fun.*

=== How To Use the Robot Determination Table
First, do not be afraid.
Second, it is as bad as it looks.

Each attribute level has it's own column. 
The player reads down each attribute level column recording the robot IDs in that column.
For example, going down the CON Level 3 column the player records *P* and *T*.
This process is repeated on for all 4 attribute levels. 
This will create a collection of letters. 
The most prevalent letter will determine the robot type. 
For example, if the total number of *H*s exceeded all other robot IDs the persona would be a hobbot.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robot_Type_Determination.adoc[]

Lets consider a bot named Sal.
Her attribute levels are CON 2, DEX 2, INT 3 and PSTR 4.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robot_Type_Example.adoc[]

.Running down each column yields the following IDs
* CON level 2 (C, D, I, M, S, V)
* DEX level 2 (D, E, I, J, M, R, S)  
* INT level 3 (C, H, M, P, R, S, V)
* PSTR level 4 (A, C, I)

Totalling the robot IDs there are 3 type C, 3 type I, 3 type M, and 3 type S
The player may choose between 4 robot types: C-Combot, I-Industrial, M-Maintenance, and S-Social.

=== Skip the Tables
If you find the byzantine, burdensome, bloviated mechanism for robot type selection this table is for you.

== Robot Type Fabrication Info
Fabricating a robot has a few of it's own unique elements. 
Attributes are generated differently.
The following attributes from the robot type must be recorded in order to generate the persona.
We will use the Datalyzer Fabrication Info as an example.

=== Heading
The heading lists the name of the robot type, it's ID, and a catchy blurb about it.
The ID is the letter in brackets.
The Datalyzer's ID is D. 
For convenience the ID is always the first letter of the robot type. 

=== Attributes
Information about attributes that define the robot or contribute to it's fabrication.

// the name primes will likely change 
==== Required Primes
These are the prime attributes that are required by the robot type.
They are NOT minimums they are exact numbers. 
So the Datalyzer must have a prime PSTR of 1 or 2.
A prime PSTR of 3 or 4 would not this robot type. 
The robotic primes and robot type selection is covered in detail at <<_robot_type,Robot Type>>

==== Attribute Minimums
A robot must convert its robot primes into regular attributes.
These regular attributes help select the robot sub type. 
A Combot has several sub types.
The persona's regular attributes would determine the sub type of combot.
For example a heavy offensive combot needs a PSTR of 27, not just a robotic prime of 4.
The Datalyzer has no sub types and therefore no attribute minimums.

==== Hit Points
Robot HPS are based on the persona's CON and robot type.
The calculation is listed for convenience and confusion. 
Detailed explanation of robot hit points can be found at <<_hit_points,Robot Hit Points>>

==== Adaptability
This is the bonus or penalty that a mechanic has to modify the robot. 
A positive adaptability is indicates a robot that can be modified more easily.
Some robots, especially combots, are resistant to being altered.

==== Size
This is a descriptor to indicate the size of this robot. 
Previously limited to indoor and outdoor sizes. 
This has been updated to indicate a range that is adjusted by CON and PSTR and type.
Very small and very large robots are not available to player personas. 
The Datalyzer is small sized which it is about half the size of an anthro

==== Value
The robot value is completely arbitrary and used for comparative purposes.
Robot value has no currency. 
The standard currency in EXP is the electrum. 
Value also doubles as the persona's social standing in the robot world. 
The value generated here is a base value which can increase with peripherals. 

=== Systems
The robotic systems are random abilities and items that are built into the robot.
They are different from adaptations added later.
Systems are baked in. 
Systems is a new approach in version 6.0.
These used to be called Attacks, Defences and Random.
The nomenclature has been rationalized.

==== Offensive 
This represents the chance that a robot will have an attack.
The attack may be a baked in weapon or a malfunctioning peripheral.
The table could say None, Auto, or a percent chance. 
The Datalyzer has a 5% chance of having an offensive system.
This would be rolled on table one in <<_offensive_systems,Offensive Systems>>

==== Defensive
This represents the chance that a robot will have an special defence.
The defence may be a baked in literal defence or a malfunctioning peripheral.
The table could say None, Auto, or a percent chance. 
The Datalyzer automatically gets one defense.

==== Peripheral 
This represents the chance that a robot will have an peripheral baked in.
Peripherals can be tools, adaptations, or skills that the robot has.
Typically these are not malfunctioning devices, but bespoke tools.
They can be magnificent or completely ridiculous.
The table could list None, Auto, or a percent chance. 
The Datalyzer automatically gets two peripherals.
The Auto is rolled on the Primary Peripheral Table.
The second roll is on the Secondary Peripheral Table.
See <<_peripheral_systems,Peripheral Systems>>


== Fabricator Type
There are no Asimovian Three Laws of Robotics in EXP.
Robots are free to smash up what and who they like.
There are some limitations though.
A robot can not wantonly harm persona from it's fabricator type.
This is the species that the robot was designed and manufactured for.
Almost all robots were fabricated by an anthro type.
In general a robot cannot harm their fabricator type. 
Nor would the robot allow her fabricator type to come to harm.
Every robot type, unless specified, follow this programming.

Robots can use non-lethal attacks, restraints, immobilization versus their fabricator type.
A robot would not simply allow itself to be destroyed. 
A robot will also protect a fabricator persona from other expedition members.
This is a major inconvenience that the player must get around when running a robot.

TIP: Rules maintain game balance and assist creativity. +
*Do not let rules get in the way of the story or the fun.*

Fabricator protection programming can be worked around. 
The more insane a robot is the more free will the robot has.
The more insane a robot is, the more flexible the application of this core programmed law.
A robot can justify deadly actions against her fabricator type.
The player would have to make a Control Factor Check.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Base_Anthro_Type.adoc[]

Most of the results on the Fabricator table are anthros.
If the player rolls anthro type equine her persona would protect and not harm equines.
Every other persona type needs to look out. 
Robots and aliens are crazy challenging.
Robots are recursively impossible. 
The referee may need to fabricate the robot fabricator or evolve an alien to fulfill the roll.

== Armour Rating
All bots have a base armour rating of 700.
It is important to note that armour rating values are the same for robots and all other personas.
A robot has no immunity from intentional damage because they are composed of special alloys.
A successful to hit roll will do damage to a robot as it would to any other target.
Robots are different from biological creatures and damage differently.
Want to know more? <<_armour_rating,Armour Rating>>

== Movement Rate
Robotic movement rate is determined by the robot's DEX attribute.

Robots are twice as fast as those personas with the same DEX.
Those bots which move faster than 8 hu, must accelerate the same as vehicles.
Robotic acceleration is one hex per unit per PSTR level (I-IV).

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Movement_Rate.adoc[]

A robot that has a 17 DEX and PSTR level of 3 would move 8 hu at first, 11 hu the next unit and then reach maximum speed of 14 hu in the next unit.
These cumbersome acceleration rules should only be applied in rare instances when the players have decided that picayune detail is of upmost importance.
Depending on the locomotion type, bots are affected by terrain just as regular personas are.
More information about robotic movement is covered under <<_locomotion,Locomotion>>.

// table insert 54

== Wate Allowance
Wate Allowance is the amount of wate that a persona can lift.
The implications of wate allowance are often ignored by referees.
Robots are affected by encumbrance similar to other personas.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Wate_Allowance.adoc[]

A robot with a PSTR level of 3 and a 17 PSTR would have a wate allowance of 75 kgs.
This means that the robot can carry 75 kgs before any movement penalties are incurred.
All penalties of encumbrance apply to robots as they would apply to other personas.


== Power Source
All bots operate on electrical power.
That electrical power comes from many different power sources. 
All cells work via ingenious advanced technological that is conveniently beyond explanation.
All robotic power sources are rechargeable.
Each power source functions equally well
The power source can go by many names: battery, cell, supercell, etc.

The robot's power source has will last one month per point of CON.
For convenience we assume that a new persona has a fully charged power source.
If the persona's CON drops then the duration of the power source drops along with it.
The robot's power source is proportional to it's use. 
No variations in use will drain the power faster or slower.

If a robot runs out of power, the persona will shut down until recharged.
The persona is not dead. 
It is just resting.
Robot personas will get a one month warning. 

It should always be made possible for a robot to recharge its power source.
Robot personas should not spend all their time searching for fuel.
One hour must be spent refuelling for each month of recharged.
Recharging could mean being plugged in, filling with water or being stuffed with materials.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Power_Cell_Type.adoc[]

=== Basic cells
Basic cells contain chemicals that react to create electricity.
One would hope that the nature of these chemicals is so advanced an explanation is optional.
For story telling purposes the chemical could be anything: natural gas, manure, hair, etc.
Recharging the power cell simply requires replacing the depleted materials.

==== Gas and Liquid Cells
Gas and liquid cells will cease operation if exposed to a vacuum.
This does not apply if the robot is exatmo hardened.
They will function as normal once atmosphere is restored.

==== Solid Cells
Solid cells function fine in vacuums, but do not function at high temperature.
Prolonged exposure to temperatures that may not damage the robot may damage its power cell.
Solid cells will function as normal once they cooled.
Extreme heat could destroy a bots solid cell.

=== Broadcast
Broadcast cells are power receivers that convert transmissions from a source into energy.
The receivers will cease to function if they are electronically jammed or out of range.
When within range the robot has an endless supply of power.
Robots using broadcast power can store one month of power per point of CON.
A robot with a broadcast power source that runs out of stored charge must be placed back in range to recharge.

=== Dynamo
Internal gyros spin up the electricity for this robot.
The countless dynamos are microscopic and silent. 
Cells offer no features beyond source.
Dynamos will not function when exposed to more than 2g.
The dynamos return to normal once gravity drops below 2g.
Dynamo cells can be recharged by plugging into the nearest electrical outlet.

=== Gravitational 
This power cell filters gravitational waves into electrical energy.
An explanation of this technological miracle will not be attempted.
The gravitational force cannot exceed 3g or be less than one half g.
The robot will store energy for those instances where gravitational cell cannot function.
The robot has 1 hour of stored energy per point of CON.
Once out of power the robot will remain dormant until gravity normalizes.

=== Magnetic 
Cellular magnetic forces are amplified to produce electrical power.
Magnetic cells will be disrupted by any magnetic based attacks or disruptions.
Severe disruptions may cause the cell to be demagnetized and require recharging.
This is left to the discretion of the referee.
Regeneration requires and electrical charge to re-magnetizes the power cells.

=== Nuclear 
The nuclear power sources uses slow burn fusion, fission, etc., to produce electricity.
It is impossible for a this persona to explode like an atomic weapon.
The nuclear cell is so efficient that there is no radiation hazard.
The nuclear power source functions in all many or atmospheres and gravities.
Fissionable materials are required to replenish the nuclear batteries.

=== Plasmoid 
Superheated gases contained in magnetic bottles fire up the robot for power.
This should make it virtually impossible for Mechanics to use the plasmoid cell maliciously.
The plasmoid cells have many safeguards that prevent their weaponization. 
Recharging plasmoid batteries requires the re-insertion of plasmodial materials.

=== Psionic 
Psionic cells convert the surrounding psychic energy into electrical energy.
The psionic cell has the most complicated recharge process.
The batteries last for the usual one month per point of CON.
When it is time to recharge the cell drains local psionic energy.
The nearest persona will to the robot will be drained one point of MSTR to fully recharge the robot.
The persona gets a save vs psionic attack. 
The robot persona uses her CON as MSTR to calculate the saving throw. 
If the persona saves the robot moves onto the next persona.
The process is automated and the robot is unaware of who is attacked when.

=== Solar 
The solar power source will keep the robot operational in any amount of light.
Artificial light and light from the nearest star work equally well.
If there is light this robot need not recharge.
If the robot should be plunged into darkness they will operate on stored power.
The robot can store 1 hour energy per point of CON.
A solar powered robot with a 16 CON could run for 16 hours in the dark.

=== Ref's Own Table
Referee can insert campaign related power sources as she sees fit.

== Sensors
All robots will have audio and video sensors which will allow the robot to hear and see.
The robotic audio and visual sensors function the same as any other persona.
To expect a player to manage otherwise would most likely be simply frustrating.
Robots do not have sensors for touch, smell or taste.
As with other personas the robot's AWE attribute is integral to the sensors.
Better awareness better sensors.
Sensors are only damaged when the persona's AWE is damaged. 
Robots will receive one additional sensor for every 4 points of AWE.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Sensors.adoc[]

=== Video
This robot has an extra set of video sensors.
These essentially act as an extra set of eyes for the robot.
These can be built into the robot's hull or conveniently attached to the end of an articulation.

=== Alternate optical
Alternate forms of optical vision include laser sights or ultraviolet/infrared detectors.
These types of vision can be included in the robot's regular vision or considered an extra component.
The alternate optical sensor allows the robot to easily see in darkness.

=== Vibrations
Vibration sensors convert molecular vibrations into comprehensible robotic vision.
This sensory feature will cut through any obscuring clouds of gas or particulate debris.
The maximum range of a vibration sensor is 5 hexes per point of AWE.
Vibration sensors are directional and the robot must look towards whatever she wants to observe.

=== Sonar
Sonar allows the bot to perceive a spherical area in the medium it is immersed in.
For instance, sonar will work equally well through air, water or smoke.
The sonar will not function beyond a transition between water and air.
The sonar range is 10 hexes her point of AWE.
Sonar cannot function in a vacuum.

=== Radar
Radar gives 360° vision around the robot.
This is a 360° disk and not a spherical area of detection.
This allows the robot to detect objects and determine their wate within 10 hexes per point of AWE.
Radar can penetrate solid objects.

=== Refs Own Table
Referee can insert campaign related sensors she sees fit.
Organic eyes, tentacles, olfactory unit, touch sensors, or a sense of style.

== Locomotion
This is how the robot moves around. 
Wheels, skis, balloons, tracks move the robot and define it's appearance.
Every robot rolls on the Primary Locomotion Table below. 
All types of locomotion perform equally.
So a robot with 3 pods would move equally to a robot with tracks. 
The persona's DEX score would be the difference not the locomotion type.

Some locomotion types require a complementary locomotion type. 
The complementary locomotion type  

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Primary_Locomotion.adoc[]


include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Secondary_Locomotion_Type.adoc[]

=== Antigrav
Antigrav is a classic science fiction term for anti-gravity.
The robot can travel about as though gravity has no effect upon it.
The robot can fly and flit about.
As ideal as antigrav is, it will only function within a gravity well.
The robot has no obvious mechanisms that create it's buoyancy in gravity.

Complementary antigrav only floats the robot, while the primary locomotion type moves the robot.
For example, a robot with jets and antigrav would float by antigrav and maneuver by the jets.
The antigrav jet driven robot would look like it is flying by jets, but would float with all jets off.

=== Chemical slide
The chemical slide allows the robot to effortlessly slide along any surface.
This process leaves a quickly evaporating trail not unlike a slug.
This comparison does not necessarily imply the bot will be slow.
A chemical slide will operate just as well up a slope as down a slope.
Sand, stairs and other difficult terrain may prove to be a challenge for a robot with this locomotive type.
How difficult such travel is depends entirely on the referee.

A complementary chemical slide is offering a frictionless surface and the primary locomotion propels it. 
For example, a robot with jets and chemical slide would stay grounded and be pushed around by jets. 

=== Electromagnetic legs (1d4)
Electromagnetic legs are visible beams the move the robot around.
A robot will have 1 to 4 electromagnetic legs.
These legs keep the robot about a meter off the ground. 
They keep the robot level on varying terrain.
Electromagnetic legs do not work on water.

=== Jets (1d4+1)
Robotic jets force gases at high speed to generate movement.
A robot will have 2 to 5 jets.
The jets create thrust and maneuverability.
Robotic jets are intake-less and do not eject dangerous super-heated propellants.
Whether jets work exatmo or not is up the referee.

=== Magnetic
A magnetic locomotion unit allows the robot to hover above the ground.
The height of the robot is fixed at no higher than 1 hex.
Magnetic locomotion is not a flying type of locomotion.
Robots with magnetic locomotion will often float around long after their destruction.
Magnetic locomotion can travel above any solid or liquid.

=== Pistons (1d10)
Pistons quickly poke up and down keeping the robot balanced and moving.
A robot has 1 to 10 pistons.
A single piston looks like a robot on a pogo stick.
The pistons are immaculately timed and keep the robot stable.
Pistons must have a solid surface to operate.

=== Pods (4d4)
Pods are articulated mechanical legs.
The robot has 4 to 16 pods.
These articulated poles will hop, scuttle or patter the robot about.
Pods require a solid surface to operate.

=== Propellers (1d6)
Robotic propellers are quiet, high-powered and safely encased air screws.
The propellers offer thrust and maneuverability to the robot. 
There are 1 to 6 propellers.
Propellers combined with antigrav would allow the robot to fly.
Propellers combined with a chemical slide would propel the slide.

=== Sails (1d3)
Sails are very sturdy, electro molecular planes that catch air for movement.
Robot sails operate perfectly well in raging wind or dead calm.
The sails offer thrust and maneuverability. 
All locomotion types are equivalent.
Movement is determined by DEX score. 
The robot will have 1 to 3 sails.


=== Skis (1d4+2)
Skis are attached to articulated pods that skate the robot over any type of terrain.
There are 3 to 6 (d4 plus 2) skis.
There is no difference in speed whether the robot is trotting uphill or sliding down slopes.

If the skis are a complementary Locomotion Type they do not function the same.
The skis are attached to articulated pods and not powered legs.
The skis would be the surface contact but jets, sails or propellers would drive the robot.

=== Slog bag
A slog bag appears as a fluid filled sack attached to the undercarriage of the robot.
The slog bag undulates and contorts itself along the surface the surface the robot travelling.
The slog bag moves like a sack of mercury, however it need not contain a liquid.
The slog bag cannot be during regular combat unless the robot's locomotion is damaged.

=== Tracks (1d6)
Robotic tracks are nothing more than rubber-coated tank tracks.
Each track is individually controlled and maneuvers by contorting itself.
There are 1 to 6 tracks.
This form of locomotion is rugged, although not especially familiar.

=== Wheels (1d12)
Robotic wheels are independently powered and controlled.
They are solid, puncture proof and 
There are 1 to 12 wheels.

When wheels are complementary locomotion type the Primary Locomotion Type generates the force.

=== Ref's Own Table
Referee can insert campaign related locomotion types as she sees fit.

== Offensive Systems
Offensive systems are attacks that the persona can use to inflict damage on targets.
This usually takes place in combat.
For a robot attack to inflict damage the player must make a successful to hit roll.
The vast majority of robot personas have no weapons at all. 

Most robotic attacks are *not* baked in weapons like guns or lazers.
The robotic persona attacks are more often malfunctioning devices.
The madness of robots allows them to use some baked in tool as if it were a gun or lazer.
Combots would be an example of a robot that would actually have a gun as a weapon.

****
A robot that has a sword attack is unlikely to have an actual built in sword.
The robot is more likely to have a shovel or dustpan, that is being used as if it were a sword.
****

Offensive Systems on the robot fabrication info table determines the type of attacks.
The higher the attack table the more deadly the attacks.
A robot fabrication sheet can indicate several different Offensive Systems.

=== Ramming 
All robots can ram.
This is the robot's most basic attack.
Ramming is when the robot self-destructively flings itself at a target.
Ramming is not a skill that robots have.
This attack a self destructive exercise.
The player must make a control factor roll before her robot can crash into something.

NOTE: *All robots can ram!* +
_After a successful control factor roll._

To inflict damage while ramming, the robot must make a successful to hit roll.
The amount of damage depends on the wate and speed of the robot.
Ramming robots also take damage when they successfully hit with a ramming attack.
Robots that have Ramming Skill from Attack Table One as an attack can ram anything that they wish.
Robotic combat is detailed in xref:iii-combat_rules:CH31_Robotic_Combat.adoc[Robot Combat].

=== Attack Table One
A player gets as many rolls on Attack Table One as indicated.
For most robots these attacks are baked in devices that are being misused by the robot.
Attacks do not require a player to make a control factor roll to misuse them.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Attack_Table_One.adoc[]

==== Deadly Peripheral
This is the most difficult attack type for the referee to run.
She and the player must decide what peripheral the robot can use as an attack.
If time is of the essence or if the player is being particularly difficult in the arbitration, then the referee can ignore this roll and have the player roll again.

This attack type is difficult because there are no guidelines for damage, range, area of effect or range of the attack.
All of these parameters must be decided before the random ability is allowed to be used as a weapon.
Some examples of deadly peripherals are given as follows: An air conditioning unit that can attack like a cryo frag grenade but can also be used to maintain a comfortable atmosphere;
a photocopier that can be used to copy leaflets or flash at targets and blind them (saving throw granted).

****
An industrial robot with a gun and a flame thrower attack would have neither.
However it could be misusing it's nail gun and malfunctioning welding tool.
****

==== Type A Weapon
These are malfunctioning peripherals that can be used as weapons by the robot.
Type A weapons are thrusting and striking weapons.
The Type A weapon is rolled on Type A Weapons.
A flag pole could attack as a lance.
A rake could attack as a pike.
A nail hammer could be used as a head hammer.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Type_A_Weapon_Type.adoc[]

==== Ramming Skill
Not all bots are able to nonchalantly crash into objects.
Normally a robot must make a control factor roll before crashing into things.
Robots with Ramming Skill from Attack Table One can ram as they please.
A robot will only be able to ram opponents with a pre-determined section of its chassis.
This part will be considered the least vital and most able to withstand the repeated punishment.
Robots with Ramming Skill are not damaged when they ram score a hit.
Robots with multiple Ramming Skills can use each one per unit of attack. 

The shape and damage delivered by the robot part is determined on Ramming Type Table. 

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Ramming.adoc[]

==== Roll On Table Two
This result let's the player roll for a more dangerous attack on Attack Table Two.  

=== Attack Table Two
A player gets as many rolls on Attack Table Two as indicated.
For most robots these attacks are baked in devices that are being misused by the robot.
Attacks do not require a player to make a control factor roll to misuse them.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Attack_Table_Two.adoc[]

==== Two Rolls on Table One
The player gets two rolls on Attack Table One. 
This can result in multiple attacks.

==== Type B Weapon
Type B weapons are non-powered ranged weapons.
They are different from guns in that they are not as powerful.
Most are malfunctioning peripherals. 
The robot is ejecting or throwing something at it's target.
Arrows, daggers and bolts could be mail guns or staplers.
A shuriken could be tin can lids.
A staff could be a rolling pin.

The referee may limit the robot's type B attack by treating the attacks as ammunition.
A robot will contain 2 to 2000 (2d1000) charges for it's type B attack.
Some type B weapons are retrievable and do not run out.
These are weapons like axes or javelins.
A robot will have to 1-8 (1d8) copies of the retrievable weapon.
For example, a robot with 4 axes could throw 4 in a row and then must retrieve them.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Type_B_Weapon_Type.adoc[]

==== Nauseating Attack
The nauseating attack makes organic creatures feel unwell.
If the target fails a saving throw she will be incapacitated by head spinning vomit sensations.
As with other robot attacks the nauseating attack is most likely a malfunction of some sort. 
The robot may spray lubricants from a fractured joint or squirt industrial products onto targets.
The attack could also be electromagnetic waves or vibrations from broken peripherals.

The range of the attack is 1 hex per 2 points of PSTR.
The intensity of the attack is randomly generated each time it is activated.
Nauseating attack has an intensity of 3 to 12 (3d4).
If the target saves vs poison, the attack has no effect.
If the persona fails her saving throw, she will be incapacitated for 0 to 3 units (1d4-1).

==== Paralyzing Attack
The paralyzing attack makes organic creatures feel weak.
If the target fails a saving throw she will be incapacitated by weakened muscles.
As with other robot attacks the paralyzing attack is most likely a malfunction of some sort. 
The robot may spray lubricants from a fractured joint or squirt industrial products onto targets.
The attack could also be electromagnetic waves or vibrations from broken peripherals.

The range of the attack is 1 hex per 2 points of PSTR.
The intensity of the attack is randomly generated each time it is activated.
Paralyzing attack has an intensity of 3 to 12 (3d4).
If the target saves vs poison, the attack has no effect.
If the persona fails her saving throw, she will be incapacitated for 0 to 3 units (1d4-1).

==== Type A Attacks
Type A attacks are deadly malfunctioning robotic devices.
There are four different types energy, inertia, stun and vibro.
For example, this could be a rake that is accidentally electrified by a short circuit.
The player will need to jump back to <<_type_a_weapon,Type A Weapon>>.
The type A weapon will then take on the properties rolled on Attack Table Two.
These attack types (energy, inertia, stun and vibro) are from xref:iv-hardware:CH49_Misc_Weapons.adoc[Miscellaneous Weapons]

//add real link
To prevent further jumping around a list of each miscellaneous weapon is included below.

Energy::
The type A weapon is energized in some capacity.
Each hit scores a damage bonus of 2-16 (2d8) HPS of zapping damage per hit.

Inertia::
The density of this type A weapon is manipulated to increase damage delivery.
Each hit scores triple damage from the type A weapon plus an additional 10 HPS. 

Stun::
Through some mechanism of electricity or toxin a successful hit can stun the target.
The target must save vs intensity 3-18 (3d6) intensity poison when a hit is scored.
A failed save will leave the target stunned for 3-18 (3d6) units of combat.

Vibro::
This type A weapon is oscillating, undulating or vibrating it's way to extra damage.
Any to hit roll made with a vibro weapon has to hit bonus of +100.
If a hit is scored there is a damage bonus of +20 HPS.

==== Roll on Attack Table Three
This is getting dangerous.
The player rolls for an attack from Attack Table Three.


=== Attack Table Three
A player gets as many rolls on Attack Table Three as indicated.
These attacks are a mix of actual weapons and baked in devices that are being misused.
Attacks do not require a player to make a control factor roll to misuse them.

==== Thermal Blast
A thermal blast can be extreme cold or heat that is ejected from the robot.
The player chooses whether the attack is hot or cold for her robot persona.
The attack has a range of 1 hex per point of DEX.
The thermal Blast must score a hit to do damage.
The attack is rolled as a Type B ranged non-powered weapon.
A thermal blast inflicts 1d6 of damage per point of PSTR.

// is this too dangerous
==== Corrosive Mist
A Corrosive Mist can an acid or alkali haze that is ejected from the robot.
The player chooses whether the attack is acid or base for her robot persona.
The attack has a range of 1 hex per point of DEX.
The Corrosive Mist must score a hit to do damage.
The attack is rolled as a Type B ranged non-powered weapon.
A Corrosive Mist inflicts 1d8 of damage per point of PSTR.

==== Gun
This is most likely an actual weapon built into the robot.
If a malfunctioning part that behaves just like a gun is preferred, story rules.
The player jumps to xref:iv-hardware:CH46_Guns.adoc.adoc[Guns]
There is one limitation on the gun type that is generated.
The gun type can only be of medium power or less. 
If a high powered calibre is rolled the gun must be re-rolled.
That may be frustrating.
Robots do not express frustration.

==== Aerosol
This is most likely an actual weapon built into the robot.
If a malfunctioning part that behaves just like a gun is preferred, story rules.
The player jumps to xref:iv-hardware:CH45_Grenades_Aerosols.adoc[Aerosols]
There is one limitation on the aerosol type rolled.
The aerosol must be a combat aerosol.
If the player rolls an aerosol that is non-combat but preferred, story rules.

=== Attack Table Four
A player gets as many rolls on Attack Table Four as indicated.
These attacks are actual weapons rather than baked in devices that are being misused.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Attack_Table_Four.adoc[]

==== 4 Rolls on Attack Table Two
Yup.
Four rolls on Attack Table Two.
This can result in a lot of attacks. 

==== 3 Rolls on Attack Table Three
Yup.
Three rolls on Attack Table three.
This can result in a lot of attacks. 

==== Killing Attack
This is a killing poison attack.
The killing poison can be a robot peripheral malfunction or a intentional weapon attack.
A malfunctioning part could spray an essential toxic fluid at the target.
If the weapon is baked in the robot could shoot a poison dart.

Killing poison has a range of 1 hex per 2 points of PSTR.
A to hit roll must be successful.
The killing poison attacks as a type C (powered missile weapon).
If a hit is scored the target must save versus poison or start to die.
The intensity of the poison is 4-16 (4d4).

The killing poison will always harm an organic target.
If the target fails her saving throw she immediately drops to -1 HPS Total.
An anthro persona at -1 HPS is dying, an alien persona at -1 HPS is dead.
A successful saving throw by the target will still inflict damage.
If the target saves, the killing poison will do 1d4 HPS damage per point of intensity.

==== Gun
This is most likely an actual weapon built into the robot.
If a malfunctioning part that behaves just like a gun is preferred, story rules.
The player jumps to xref:iv-hardware:CH46_Guns.adoc.adoc[Guns]
There is one limitation on the gun type that is generated.
The gun type can only be of medium power or higher. 
If a low calibre gun is rolled the gun must be re-rolled.

==== Grenade/Aerosol
This is most likely an actual weapon built into the robot.
If a malfunctioning part that behaves just like a gun is preferred, story rules.
The player jumps to xref:iv-hardware:CH45_Grenades_Aerosols.adoc[Aerosols]
There is one limitation on the area of effect weapon type rolled.
The area of effect weapon must be a combat one.

==== Bomb
This is most likely an actual weapon built into the robot.
If a malfunctioning part that behaves just like a gun is preferred, story rules.
The player jumps to xref:iv-hardware:CH44_Bombs.adoc[Bombs]
A robot is limited to one bomb attack. 

==== Corrosive Jet
A Corrosive Mist can an acid or alkali jet that is ejected from the robot.
The player chooses whether the attack is acid or base for her robot persona.
The attack has a range of 1 hex per point of DEX.
The Corrosive Jet must score a hit to do damage.
The attack is rolled as a Type C powered missile weapon.
A Corrosive Jet inflicts 1d12 of damage per point of PSTR.

==== Mutation 
The robot will have a baked in weapon that functions like a mutation.
The mutation type can be a Mental Mutation or a Physical Mutation.
If the player rolls less than her Robot's CON on 1d100 the mutation will a xref:vi-mutations:CH59_Physical.adoc[Physical Mutation].
If the player rolls higher than her Robot's CON the mutation will be a xref:vi-mutations:CH58_Mental.adoc[Mental Mutation].

The mutation must be an attack mutation. 
If the player wishes to roll a completely random mutation instead then so be it.
The robot cannot have a defective mutation under any circumstances. 
When attacking the robot uses her INT instead of her MSTR.

==== Disregard Fabricator
This does not count as a roll on Robotic Attack table Four.
This robot no longer needs to make a control factor check to harm her fabricator type. 

==== Ref's Own Table
Look out world here comes something crazy.

== Defensive Systems
Defensive systems can be anything that makes the robot harder, to hit, damage or control.
Robot defences can be malfunctioning peripherals used as a defence in combat.
However most are hardenings that protect the robot while doing its work.

Unlike the convoluted attack tables there is only one Defensive Systems Table.
Each robot type has clear direction on how to approach this table. 
Some robots have no roll on Defensive Systems.
Others are designated multiple rolls.  

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Defences.adoc[]

=== Anti-Missile
This defensive system protects the robot from flying attack.
The defence could be a baked in defense or a peripheral being used creatively.
Anti-missile is a combination of evasive actions, hardened casing and flechette. 
Any ranged attack can be thwarted by this defence.
This includes: type B weapons, guided bombs, missiles, grenades, rockets or directed aerosols.
The defence does not work against powered small arms attacks like guns or crossbows (type C).

The robots AR is increased by 50 to 300 (50d6 or 1d6 times 50) against missile attacks.
If the to hit roll fails the robot has destroyed the incoming attack. 
This will negate any area of effect damage that the missile could have delivered.

A successful to hit roll will limit the damage to area of effect damage.
Any damage delivered will be cut in half.

=== Anti-Personnel
Designed to remove clamouring parasites or grappling hordes.
The mechanism of the anti-personnel device is chosen by the player.
The player can choose the nature of the noxious anti-personnel attack.
For example, electric shock, sonic attack, flames, shrapnel, or cotton candy webs.
Regardless of the appearance of the defence all types will function the same.

Anti-personnel affects targets touching the robot or in the robot's immediate area.
The defence has no effective range.
The anti-personnel does not attack immobilized or incapacitated targets.
The player rolls 3d6 each time the defence is activated.
When activated the player can choose between lethal or non-lethal defence.

==== Lethal Anti Personnel
As a lethal defence every organic target with the limited range takes damage.
No to hit roll is necessary as this is an area of effect attack.
The close proximity attackers must make a saving throw versus pain.
The intensity of the attack is equal to the damage delivered. 
A failed saving throw will cause them to fall back at least one hex from the robot.

==== Non Lethal Anti-Personnel
The none lethal version of this defence effects every organic target within range.
While no damage is done the target automatically falls back from the robot in pain.
The referee may allow player persona's a saving throw versus pain to stay on the robot.
If the player persona successfully stays on the robot they will take 3-18 (3d6) HPS of damage.

When using non-lethal anti-personnel the robot can move freely through riotous swarm.

=== Increase AR
The increase in armour rating could be chassis hardening, evasive maneuvers, or some combo.
The armour rating of the robot increases by 50 to 300 (1d6 times 50).
The effects of this defence are cumulative. 
Multiple visits to this defence increases the AR each time.
This can lead to armour ratings well above the robot's base of 700.

=== Artifact Armour
This robot's hull is replaced by fancy armour from xref:iv-hardware:CH42_Armour.adoc[Armour]
The robot could be covered in relfec, ballistic, a force field, or even powered armour.
There is a limitation on the armour type.
The armour type cannot make the robot weaker.
For example, the armour rating cannot drop below 700.

=== Camouflage
Often the best defence is being able to hide.
The defence is combination of colouring and structural changes that allow the robot to blend in.
The robot can camouflage against any type of sensor that it has.
A robot with radar and video sensors could camouflage against radar and video.
This would make it essentially invisible to those types of vision.
This is a defensive skill and does not offer any bonus for ambush. 
A persona will only detect this robot if she is actively searching the area.

=== Detect ambush
This defence makes it very difficult to surprise this robot.
The robot is four times more likely to detect something detrimental to it.
The persona's AWE score is quadrupled (times 4) when detecting an ambush
The defence includes active and passive ambush situations. 
A robot with AWE 12 would use an AWE 48 detecting mines, trip wires or traps.

=== Diffuse Bombs
This robot is a demolitions demolishing expert.
The robot has both the technical and mechanical skills to defuse all types of bombs.
The robot functions as a 5th level mechanic, plus the robot's EXPS level when diffusing bombs.
When using the Mechanic PT roll the persona doubles her INT score when diffusing bombs. 
This defence does not assist the robot in planting or making bombs.

=== Evasive action
Allows the robot to avoid combat situations entirely, providing it is not engaging combat itself.
This is essentially a computerized tactical withdrawal mode.
It allows the robot to move at normal through mine fields, tank traps, phalanx of soldiers and other such detriments to escape.
Each time the robot encounters an escape obstacle, it can avoid it with a d20 DEX roll.
No robot can attack while employing this defence (unless it is a combat robot).

=== Force Field
This is the classic science fantasy defensive force field.
The force field will absorb any HPS in damage that should be taken by the robot.\
A force field will be able to absorb 25 to 100 HPS of damage (1d4 times 25).
Multiple force fields are added together and function as a single device.
The force field will shut down for 1 minute per HPS absorbed once depleted.

=== Increase HPS
This robot just increased it's ability the take damage.
Increasing HPS makes the robot a bit tougher
Each time Increase HPS is visited the HPS are increased. 
The effect is cumulative.
The robot's HPS are increased by 10% to 60% (d6 times 10%).
A robot with 100 HPS and an increase HPS of 30% would have 130 HPS.

=== Mental mutation
This robot has a peripheral that has the same effect as a mental mutation.
The defence could be a baked in defense or a creatively used peripheral malfunction.
The player makes  a jump to xref:vi-mutations:CH58_Mental.adoc[Mental Mutations].

The mutation should be a defensive mutation.
The player may spend some time at xref:vi-mutations:CH58_Mental.adoc[Mental Mutations] rolling and rolling.
If the player wishes to roll a completely random mutation instead then so be it.
The robot cannot have a defective mutation under any circumstances. 
The robot cannot have a purely attack mental mutation.
When attacking the robot uses her INT instead of her MSTR.

=== Override interrupt
The robot is immune to robotic override.
The defence protects against attempt to make her subservient.
The referee may feel that a global defence to robotic override is too powerful.
If this is the case this robot can triple her INT vs robotic override and can check 3 times more often 

== Peripheral Systems
Peripherals give the robot flexibility to perform it's tasks.
Some peripherals are completely incongruous to the robot type and that is fine.
Why wouldn't a combat robot have a tea service built in.
Peripherals are not malfunctioning parts, but baked in robot controlled devices.

Every robot gets one roll on the Primary Peripheral Table. 
A percentage value indicates the chance of an extra roll.
Some robots do not have peripherals and that is indicated on the fabrication into

The peripherals rolled here can be used creatively but cannot by used in combat.
Aroma producing could not be used to make a nausea attack, but it could help sell a house.
An articulation could not strangle an opponent but it could open a door.

Sometimes the player and referee come to an impasse regarding the creative use of a peripheral.
This is best resolved using xref:ii-combat_rules:CH16_Special_Rolls.adoc#-sphincter_dice[Sphincter Dice]

=== Primary Peripheral
Primary peripherals are not fancy. 
A primary peripheral will only mildly alter the robots function or value.
The powerful game changing peripherals are on the Secondary Peripheral Table.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Primary_Robotic_Peripherals.adoc[]

=== Secondary Peripheral
Secondary peripherals can be game changers.
Mild mannered robots can pursue a vocation.
Most secondary peripherals represent a combination of hardware and software.
These peripherals are not overly detailed as they are non-combat peripherals.
This does not mean that they are not powerful.
A robotic mutation could allow a robot to stop time.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Secondary_Peripherals.adoc[]

== Shape
Most robots have a mechanical shape. 
Unless the robot has some skill that disguises itself robots appear like robots.
The robot shape has no bearing on attacks, peripherals or defences.
The player can choose what she likes: fire hydrant, filing cabinet, kitchen appliance, etc.
If some random assistance is needed consult the below tables.
The tables only offer a shape. 
The colour, design, sound, decals, smell, or detailing is up to the player.
The referee may have some commercial patching depending on the campaign.

=== Basic Shape
The volume of the robot will fit into this shape.
Feel free to contort the shape.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Basic_Shape.adoc[]

=== Contortion of Basic Shape
This table manipulates the basic shape so that the infinity that is commercial design is reflected.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Basic_Shape_Adjustment.adoc[]

== Robot Size
The robot has a general descriptor of size. 
Size is used to determine the Hite and Wate of the robot.
The robot sizes: Tiny, Small, Medium, Large and Gigantic.
There are two other sizes not included for player personas.
These are Minute and Humungous. 
They only appear for referee personas.
The list of robot sizes are somewhat human relatable. 

=== Wate
The Wate of a robot is the combination of mass and weight that is used by all personas in EXP.
A 100kg robot has the same Wate as a 100kg anthro.
Wate is very important to robots as it determines how much damage is when ramming.
Ramming is the only universal robotic attack.
The majority of player persona robots will be either Small, Medium or Large.
Player persona robots Wate is not adjusted by Tech Level. 

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Size_Wate.adoc[]

=== Hite
The Hite of the robot is measured in centimeters (cm).
Robot Hite can also represent the volume of the robot.
The referee and persona can decide how many times to roll on the Hite Table
If desired the player can roll three times: once for each of hite, width and length.
The dimensions can be arranged in whatever order works best for the persona.
If the robot dimensions are ruining a finely tuned player persona ignore them.

TIP: Rules maintain game balance and assist creativity. +
*Do not let rules get in the way of the story or the fun.*

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robot_Dimensions.adoc[]

== Control Factor
Control Factor (CF) is a measure of the robot's free will.
CF is an attribute unique to the family machinae.
The higher the control factor the more easily the player can control her persona.
A robot's control factor depends on her INT and improves with EXPS levels.

=== Robot Control Factor
.CF= (INT score) + (Prime INT * EXPS Level)
****
A 3rd level robot with a 15 INT score, and a 3 INT Prime would have a CF = 24
****

=== Why Control Factor?
Robots are not fabricated with free will in mind. 
A robot is supposed to follow the direction of it's owners, or at least it's fabricators.
An industrial janitorial bot is supposed to clean the factor and nothing else. 
Player persona robots are _broken_.
Player persona robots are considered insane and rogue.
The free will expressed by the player is considered a malfunction by the robot's fabricators.

The robot personas controlled by the players are insane robots who don't care much for being slaves.
From a robot perspective insane does not mean mentally ill.
An insane robot is one with free will. 
Allowing the player to run the robot persona like an irrational player.

NOTE: For a robot *insane* means free willness, not mental illness.

=== Control Factor Checks

Robots were not fabricated to exercise their free will and ignore their programmed tasks.
Whenever a robot is challenged to "get back to work" she must make a control factor check.
The control factor check is a die roll that the player makes to keep control of her persona.
If the control factor check fails the player can only do what her robot was programmed to do.

For example, domestic janitorial bot could be find itself in a messy bathroom.
The referee could challenge to bot to a Control Factor Check to *not* clean the bathroom.
If the player fails the CF check the persona will need to clean the bathroom before doing anything else.
The referee and players will decide how frequent control factor checks are made. 
The frequency of Control Factor Checks can be frequent or infrequent. 
Some referees will have the players checking several times a session.

TIP: Rules maintain game balance and assist creativity. +
*Do not let rules get in the way of the story or the fun.*

=== CF Check Difficulty
The difficulty of the CF Check is determined by the referee and player. 
The more difficult the CF Check the more likely the player will lose control of the robot.
For a domestic janitorial bot to ignore cleaning a messy bathroom would be easy difficulty.
For a domestic janitorial bot to mess up a clean bathroom would be hard difficulty.
In the first case the robot could go about her business exhibiting free will.
In the second case the robot would likely not be able to intentionally mess up the bathroom.

****
Control Factor checks are being worked into the High Roll Paradigm. There are no procedural details on CF checks at present. See  xref:ii-non_combat_rules:CH16_Special_Rolls.adoc[Special Rolls]  for rework in progress.
****

=== Loss of Control
A failed CF check will indicate that the player has temporarily lost control of her persona.
The player still runs the robot persona, but she can only do things that the robot would do
CF Checks should be fun. 
They can even be funny.
CF Checks should add to the story and fun of role playing. 
It would be an example of extreme __roll playing__ to destroy a robot persona with a CF Check.

== Robot Hit Points
Robots are inorganic fabricated entities.
They do not have a physiology per se.
Consequently physical damage affects robots different from anthros and aliens. 
While a hit point in damage is still a hit point in damage the affect is different.
The main difference between robotic and organic (anthros and aliens) is that robots do not 'die' at zero.
For a robot 0 HPS indicates something has broken rather than complete destruction.

=== Calculating Robotic Hit Points
Each robot type has Hit Points listed on it's fabrication info sheet. 
The persona hit points are calculated when the robot type has been determined.
An explorations robot (E) with a 20 CON would have 300 HPS.
A datalyzer (D) with a 4 CON could have between 12 and 16 HPS.

== Damaging Robots
When a robot is damaged there are no organic repair systems to fix things up.
Anthros and aliens have organic systems that repair themselves with time.
Robots just keep taking more and more damage.
Eventually the robot's hit point total will be reduced to zero. 

Damage to a robot is the same as damage to any other persona.
A punch does same damage to a robot as an organic target.
Electrical and disintegration attacks are especially damaging to robot personas.
Any electrical or disintegration attack does double damage to a robot. 
When a robot is hit, any damage it takes is subtracted from its HPS total.
This means that a robot will quickly lost HPS and will be unable to heal itself.

Repairing robots is risky.
Robotic free will depends on malfunctions.
A properly repaired robot would no longer have free will.
The greater the repair the more difficult the Control Factor Check

=== Zero HPS
When a robot's HPS total drops below zero several things happen:
.Consequences of Zero HPS
. A System is permanently damaged
. <<_hps_max_decrease,HPS Max Decreases>> by 10%
.. HPS Total becomes new HPS Max
. An EXPS level is gained
. <<_attribute_decrease,Attribute Decrease>> may occur

=== HPS Max Decrease
.New HPS Max = old HPS Max times 0.9
****
HPS Max of 110 drops to 99. HPS Total resets to new HPS Max. 
The result must be rounded down. 
****

Each time the persona's HPS Total is reduced to zero the robot loses 10% off her HPS Max.
A robot with 110 HPS Max would lose 10% when her HPS Total drops below zero.
After her first drop below zero HPS her new HPS Max would be 99. 
The persona's HPS Total becomes the new HPS Max.
This drop in the HPS Max continues until the robot is destroyed (HPS Max of Zero).

****
Consider a fresh new robot with 110 HPS Max.
She takes 115 HPS of damage.
Her HPS Total would drop to zero. 
She would have a new HPS MAX of 99 and subtract the remaining 5 HPS of damage from 99.
Her new HPS Max would be 99 and her HPS Total would be 94.
****

This drop in HPS Max would continue until the HPS Max is less than one.
That would result in a destroyed robot. 
The above robot drops her HPS Max by 10% each time her HPS Total is zeroed.
Her HPS Max would decrease like so: 110, 99, 89, 80, 72, 64, 57 etc.
She would be destroyed at Zero HPS Max. 
The total damage (by most python models) would be 970 HPS in damage.
This seems like a lot however it is nearly impossible for robots to repair. 

=== Attributes Decrease
Robots do not only lose HPS when they are damaged.
The robot can also lose attribute scores each time her HPS Total reaches zero.
They are tough compared to organic personas but they are far from indestructible.
If any attribute is reduced to zero the robot is destroyed. 

A critical malfunction to the robot brain would reduce the persona's INT score by 2 points.
So a robot with an 11 INT would have their INT reduced to 9.
The referee and players may choose to recalculate any range effects based on INT.
It is also equally acceptable to ignore doing such arithmetic.
There is enough arithmetic in robot damage already.
If any of the robot's attributes fall below 1 the robot is destroyed.

This does not effect the robot's attribute range. 
A robot with a INT Range of 4 still has an INT Range of 4
This effects any of the attribute scores: AWE, CHA, CON, DEX, INT, and PSTR.
If any of these attributes fall below 1 the robot is destroyed.

=== Robot Decay Tables
Robot decay tables are essential for referee personas. 
The decay table has all damage effects for the robot persona prepared. 
Player persona usually will visit the system damage tables each time they zero their HPS Total.

== Robot Adaptability
Only Mechanics can fit peripheral devices onto bots and this is done using the _Mechanics`' Performance Tables_.
The ADAPTABILITY is the percentage added to the Mechanic's PT roll, thus increasing the mechanic's chance for success.
The Degree of Difficulty of the particular procedure is determined by the ref.
Those bots with no adaptability percentage are designed to not be tampered with and instead of a PT roll bonus, the Mechanic suffers a 3 DD penalty.

== Robot Value
The value of the bot is its base worth relative to all the robot types described.
The values indicated are for the basic unit that rolls off the assembly line.
The strange peripherals that may have just happened, or are added to the basic robot type, increase the robot's value.
Primary peripherals are worth about 10000 to 60000 each and secondary peripherals about 100000 to 600000 each.
The adjustment of the robot's base value is really up to the referee.
Any artifacts that are attached to the robot are tripled in value and added to the robot's value.
Robots that are worth incredible sums of money or have particularly valuable peripherals will often find themselves being greedily pursued by former owners or prospective "`buyers`".

== Tech Level
The player should roll a http://expgame.com/?page_id=359[Chapter 56 Tech Level] for her robot persona.
This roll can adjust the wate and value of the robot.
A strange tech level could possibly make it more difficult to adapt a robot.
The tech level roll can make a robot lighter but it cannot make it any heavier.
If no tech level is rolled, the robot is assumed to have a tech level of 10.

== Experience
As a bot gains more experience, it begins to solidify and reinforce its individuality and personality.
The robot becomes more insane as it gathers data moderated by its own free will.
The more individualistic and independent it becomes, the more insane it is.
Remember that insanity in a robot does not mean lunacy, just robotic free will.
Robots will gain experience by engaging in combat, taking damage and taking more damage.

5% of combat EXP's can be converted into data that will reinforce the robot's independent thought.
Nothing will increase the robot's free will more than damage.
Robots will earn 20 EXP's per HPS of damage they take.
Increasing a robot's level will increase its control factor and hence its free will.

Bots cannot acquire experience points for performing functions for which they were designed.
A domestic bot will not get experience for cleaning a room but will be rewarded if lucky enough to expose an informative fresco in the process of doing so.
A bot with painting skill would not be rewarded for painting a house but would gain experience points for using that same ability to spray paint into the eyes of the opponent.
So, novel use of a built-in skill will be rewarded with experience points.
