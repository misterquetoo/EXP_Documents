Felines are cat people.
Felines can also be referred to as Homo Felis.
They have furry bodies, long slender tails and mouths full of sharp little teeth.
The anthro type feline is purely descriptive and has no abilities other than those described here.
For example, a leopard fashioned feline persona could *not* accelerate up to 100 km/h to catch prey (or more likely a bus).
Some of the cat types that felines may resemble are: Siamese, Manx, lion, tiger, puma, jaguar, leopard, ocelot, etc.

Felines have a keen sense of balance and agility.
Because of this, felines enjoy a +30% movement bonus.
Therefore, a feline with a 5 h/u movement rate would move at 6.5 h/u which is rounded up to 7 h/u.

Such speed and agility was once needed by felines in order to catch prey but this was before they could buy it at the supermarket.
The ability to ambush prey is an asset too and felines get a bonus when trying to ambush a target.
This bonus only applies when the feline is acting alone or the entire ambushing expedition is feline.
An ambushing feline can subtract her DEX from the target’s AWE.
So if a feline with a 14 DEX is trying to ambush a target that has a 16 AWE, the target’s effective AWE is reduced to 2.
This is very devastating to the target.
Homo Felis has equal nite/day vision.
This allows them to operate in darkness without any penalty.
