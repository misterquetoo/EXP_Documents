= Anthro RP

Anthro referee personas (RP) will be the most common type of referee persona that the referee will introduce to the expedition.
These referee personas can vary from altruistic veterinarians that are placing themselves at risk to heal the expedition to ruthless anti-knites that are using the expedition as a disposable tool in their quest for universal chaos.
Other referee personas will be colourful campaign descriptors like meaningless civilians that clog sidewalks or mutant markets.
Such anthro referee personas should require no more personification than an accented voice or a marker on the table.
If the poor innocent civilian is unfortunate misfortune to happen upon the expedition during a combat situation then a little more preparation is required.

Most referees will be reading this chapter already knowing exactly what they want to create and the data here will supply a guideline.
For instance, she may need a knite to give the indication that one of the personas is ready to ascend, the campaign may need a veterinarian to help the expedition stay healthy, or she may even need a spie to track down the personas to settle some score that has been left unbalanced.

The largest source of detailed anthro personas is the persona morgue.
These are ready-made referee personas that may even include a personality.
It is not recommended that the ref directly plagiarize a player's old persona but merely use it for inspiration.

== Sidewalk Civilians

These are the unprepared personas that simply fill the streets of a city, village, or spacecraft in an effort to describe a crowd.
Such personas will generally have no more than 9 HPS, no weapons, and no combat table.
Any civilian attributes that are required are rolled as needed and usually need not be recorded.
If the ref is suspicious of the expedition's intentions when entering a civilian area, she may generate several sets of attributes for those exceptional civilians that are capable of defending themselves.

== 2-2) Anthropomorph Referee Personas

Anthro referee personas (RP) will be the most common type that the referee will introduce to the expedition.
Such referee personas can vary from altruistic veterinarians that are placing themselves at risk to heal the expedition to ruthless anti-knites that are using the expedition as a disposable tool in their quest for universal chaos.

*Sidewalk Civilians*: These are the unprepared personas that simply fill the streets of a city, village, or spacecraft in an effort to describe a crowd.
Such personas will generally have no more than 9 HPS, no weapons, and no combat table.
Any civilian attributes that are required are rolled as needed and usually need not be recorded.
If the ref is suspicious of the expeditions intentions when entering a civilian area, she may generate several sets of attributes for those exceptional civilians that are capable of defending themselves.

*True Referee Personas*: In those instances where the expedition comes across a true referee persona, the ref must be fully prepared with attributes, family, mutations, class, level, personality, and equipment.
There is no telling what will be required of the persona once it is introduced to the expedition.
These are the referee personas where the ref must have a reasonably detailed origin, presence, and goal.


== 1) Origin, Presence, and Goal

As previously stated, referee personas can have a wide degree of involvement in a campaign or with an expedition.
All referee personas must have an origin, presence, and goal.
The origin of an RP should explain where it came from and why it things the way it does.
The presence of the RP will dictate how and why it interacts with the expedition.
The goal of an RP is what it wants from the campaign, dictating what it will do with the expedition and when it will part company.

For 95% of the RPs the expedition will encounter, the Trinity of the RP (origin, presence, and goal) will be pre-determined.
Referee personas such as innocent civilians and animals will have simplistic origins such as migrating through the area or on their way to work.
Their presence might be riding on the subway or rummaging through the bushes.
Their goal may be to find some berries to eat or to get to work on time.
If the expedition frequently intervenes in the lives of such unimportant referee personas, the referee need have no more prepared than usual.

If the referee persona is a more important one the referee must create  a more detailed origin, presence, and goal.
Let's consider a young man from the farming district of his impoverished planet (origin) is willing to hire on for the expedition as a porter (presence) if they will take him off planet (goal).
Another referee persona could be a very hungry alien that just jumped out of a tree (origin) and is ferociously attacking the expedition (presence) because the alien's hungry and the expedition members look like something good to eat (goal).

Other RPs may have much more complex origins, presences, and goals.
Vishna Shraloor is a referee persona with death field generation (a mental mutation).
She matured not knowing that this lethal power was within her.
She grew up through a series of profound personal tragedies: the death of her parents, the death of teachers, the death of mourning relatives, the death of her playmates, the death of social workers, and the death of foster parents.
Many of these deaths may have been caused by her misunderstood mental ability.
That is her sad origin.

Vishna's presence is one of a lonely unhappy persona who constantly associates with people she does not like because the people around her tend to die frequently.
Her profession is that of an orbital satellite repair person, a solitary job for certain.
She has chosen to hang around with the expedition because she does not particularly like them much.
This is her presence.

Ms. Shraloor's goals are varied.
She would like to destroy the society that has rejected her so totally and she sees the expeditions mentality as something that she can exploit to this end.
If an expedition member should happen to befriend her, show her the nature of her mutation, and nurse her through the subsequent guilt, she may follow another path and desire to help the society that continued to reach out to her despite their extreme risk.
These are her potential goals.

This chapter provides no guidelines on preparing an origin or goal for the referees personas but it does help with the presence of the referee personas.
In fact, this chapter could be considered a guide on how to prepare a referee personas presence.
If the ref knows that she needs RPs but has no origins or goals, then it might help to create the persona presence first.
This is an excellent procedure for sparking the imagination or solidifying a watery idea.

== True Referee Personas

In those instances where the expedition comes across a true referee persona, the ref must be fully prepared with attributes, anthro type, mutations, class, level, personality, and equipment.
There is no telling what will be required of the persona once it is introduced to the expedition.
These are the referee personas where the ref must have a reasonably detailed origin, presence, and goal.

== Anthro RP Checklist

== 1) Anthro RP Attributes

Anthro referee persona attributes are generated as per Table 11-2.2: Anthro RP Attributes.
As always the referee should alter the attributes to the needs of the story and how the referee persona fits in.
Upward and downward attribute adjustment tables are included here in case the referee needs a slow or ugly persona.

Referees need to show some discretion when they choose to make upwards attribute adjustments.
There are many ways that an referee persona can have her attributes adjusted upwards.
There are the adjectives listed on Table 11-2.: Upwards Anthro RP Adjustments.
Then there are further upwards adjustments that are attributed to anthro type, and then more attribute adjustments attributed to class.
Not all referee personas are super heroes.
At most one attribute should be supercharged.

== 2) Anthro RP Type

he referee may not be certain which anthropomorph type she wants her RP to have.
This can be determined on Table 11.4: Anthropomorph Type.
Regardless of whether the anthro type was predetermined or randomly generated, there are other factors that she must consider.The referee must choose a decorative subspecies for the persona.
Florians may be petunias or fungi;
Insectoids may be ants, spiders, or mantis;
and so on.
The available choices of subspecies are so extensive that no tables have been prepared and the ref must choose the decorative subspecies on her own.
The sex of an RP is chosen randomly (1-3 female;
4-6 male), the gender could be any combination of those.

// insert table 278

If the RP still does not meet class or racial requirements, remember RPs are assumed to have an origin of some sort and those missing the required attributes may have originally been nothings or lost the attribute points during some traumatic part of their origin.
If the referee feels that RPs must have the required attributes for their class, the offending attributes may be re-rolled.
Remember that racial attribute requirements only apply to personas while rolling up and any attribute changes that subsequently occur cannot force a persona from her anthro type.

// insert table 279

== 3) Anthro RP Hite and Wate

Each anthro type's hite equation and base wate is listed on Table 11-2.7: Anthro Hite and Wate.
For a more detailed explanation of how Hite and Wate work please refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=101[Chapter 4: Anthropomorphs].
Hite and Wate can be adjusted for adjectives like tall, skinny, short and obese.
The adjustments are listed on the Upward and Downward Anthro Attribute Adjustments.

// insert table 280

== 4) Anthro RP Hit Points

A referee persona's Hit Points (HPS) maximum is determined the same as any other anthro persona.
The HPS Max are determined by the persona's CON attribute.
As the referee has more and more anthro RPs succumb violently to the paranoia of player personas there may be a desire to give all their referee persona's high CONs and the upward attribute adjustment of Resilient.
Don't bother.
If the referee cannot keep her referee personas out of combat by role playing there will be no amount of hit points that will keep her alive.

*Hit Points Maximum = (1/2 CON x d8) + CON*

The persona's CON attribute plays an important role in determining the persona's HPS Max.
The referee persona's HPS Max is determined by rolling d8s.
A referee should roll 1d8 for every two points of Con.
The total of these d8s comprises a large component of the HPS.
The referee persona's HPS are then adjusted by her CON attribute.
For every 1 point of CON the persona has, 1 hit point is added to the HPS Max.

== 5) Anthro RP Age

The age range of the anthro referee persona is first determined on Table 11-2.8: Anthro RP Age Category.
Then the exact age in years depending on the anthro type an age range is determined from Table 11-2.9: Anthro RP Age by making the die roll indicated on the Table 11-2.9.

// insert table 281

// insert table 282

== 6) Anthro RP Social Standing

This is an optional attribute.
It is only essential for the persona class nothing.
Social Standing (SS) rolled on a d1000 and the players CHA is added to the roll.
Social Standing can be upward (famous) or downward (shunned) adjusted as per Table 11-2.3 and Table 11-2.4.

== 7) Anthro RP Mutations

Mutations can simply be chosen from Chapter 55 or Chapter 56 to create the anthro referee persona that is desired.
If randomness is ruling the creation of this referee persona.
If the referee would like the anthro RP to be more likely to mutate she can halve the 1d100 die roll, therefore doubling the chance of mutations.

// insert table 283

== 8) Anthro RP Movement Rate

Movement rate for anthro referee personas is determined in the same fashion as for player personas.
The upwards (fast) and the downwards (slow) attribute modifiers can alter the movement rate of the referee persona.

// insert table 284

== 9) Anthro RP Armour Rating

Personal body armour is a perverse form of self-defense.
It is designed to protect someone who cannot, or will not, avoid combat situations.
It is as much an instrument of violence as any weapon.
The best way to avoid taking damage from combat is to avoid combat, but many personas happily wade into any altercation they can find or create.The body armour described in this chapter is mundane, or non-artifact, armour.
Artifact armour is described in http://expgame.com/?page_id=331[Chapter 42: Armour], and includes things like force fields, laser reflection, and powered armour.
Mundane armour is not as exciting as artifact armour, and it is usually cumbersome, uncomfortable and difficult to put on.#

*Anthro Armour Rating (AR) = 500 plus six times DEX*




== 9) Referee Persona Name

Often the most important part of a referee persona is its name.
The description of a humanoid may be glossed over and that of an aliens forgotten completely but the name will always be remembered.
The players will recall an RPs name before they will remember her personality, dress, or special abilities.
There is no question that a referee personas name is much more important to the campaign than that of an expedition persona.
Often an RPs name will have some significance, like a veterinarian named Ivy Blodgett or a melancholic nothing named Sue Siedal.

Robots are more difficult to name because there is some unwritten rule that they must have letters and numbers in their names, like: QT, oicur12, unit 42, or SNOO-KM series.
Remember the more insane the robot, the more free willed it is and the more likely that it will have named itself.
Additional names that the referee may be required to produce for an RP robot are manufacturers name, model line, and unit name.

Alien families are fun to name.
The referee will often be naming an entire family as well as the specific species member that she has created.
A helpful hint in naming alien families is to avoid personification.
No self-respecting space-faring family would call itself the Obese Ones,
or the Furry Ones.
If such alien properties are important to an alien family (which they might well be), translations can mean anything the referee likes and the Vojing Dur
may translate into Obese Ones
but in that aliens tongue (if they have tongues) human
might translate into scrawny geeks.
Always keep in mind that these creatures are alien and alien sounding words that reflect the alien are the most useful and fun.
