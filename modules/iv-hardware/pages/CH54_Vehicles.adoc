[.s1]#A vehicle is essentially any machine designed to #[.s2]#help personas get from point A to point B.
The #[.s3]#vehicles designed in this chapter are of the mindless, #[.s1]#planet bound variety.
The vehicles are mindless #when compared to robots, and planet bound when [.s4]#compared to spaceships.
This point is not meant to #[.s5]#encroach on the referee&#8217;s artistic license (because #[.s1]#intelligent spacefaring Edsels may be the basis of #[.s2]#her campaign), but to merely point out that the #[.s5]#vehicles generated in this chapter will not turn out #[.s2]#like that.#

[.s6]#Vehicles are much more common than #[.s2]#spaceships, and in most campaigns the planet&#8217;s surface, and atmosphere, will be polluted with #vehicles.
Because of this vehicular profusion, it is [.s4]#recommended that the referee create several vehicle #types to be re-used frequently.
Like the spaceship [.s1]#creation system, the vehicle creation system does not lend itself to on-the-spot toys.#

[.s7]#The vehicle system is designed with #[.s8]#anthropomorph personas in mind.
This means #[.s9]#that the seating and vehicle mechanisms are #[.s5]#fashioned for use by anthropomorphs.
The referee #[.s1]#can use the vehicle system to create vehicles for #[.s4]#aliens, or robots, but this chapter will immediately #[.s1]#accommodate them.#

[.s1]#Since this vehicle creation system is bizarre #[.s4]#at the very least, what is considered a basic vehicle #should be considered.
A basic vehicle will almost [.s5]#certainly come with an engine, a body, a braking #[.s3]#system, a steering device, and some space to harbor #[.s1]#passengers.
Other items that should be included are: windscreens, roof, signal lights, instrument #[.s5]#panels, and doors.
From the second list any of the items can be eliminated because of terrain, purpose of vehicle, or performance capacity.
If the ref tries #[.s1]#to eliminate any of a vehicle&#8217;s essential requirements, a very good explanation is necessary.#

== The Build {.p4}

[table id=881 /]

== [.s2]#1) Primary Format# {.p5}

The primary format of a vehicle indicates those parameters that it was originally manufactured with.
The die roll determines the vehicle&#8217;s basic design immediately after manufacture (whether it was produced by hand or by assembly line).
Roll once on Table 54.1: Primary Format to determine the vehicle&#8217;s basic structure.
This basic form decides: the number of passengers, cargo space, size, wate, and general description of the vehicle.
Each format type has several subcategories, each of which gives a more specific description of the vehicle.
Imaginative players, and refs, are not restricted to the vehicle type rolled, these are supplied merely to give some idea of the purpose [.s12]#and dimension of the vehicle rolled.#

*Type*: This describes what kind of base vehicle the primary format is.
It references vehicles that we are phenotypically familiar with so that there is a frame of reference.
The vehicles need not look like this at all.
The type also defines the basic allocation of passengers and cargo

[.s5]#*Wate*: The vehicle wate is simply a guideline #[.s2]#that indicates the vehicle&#8217;s unloaded wate in tonnes.
The #referee may have to adjust the wate depending on what is [.s2]#attached to the vehicle.#

[.s14]#*Passengers*:#[.s1]#The number of passengers refers to the number of seats that are present to safely carry personas.
Obviously more passengers can be #[.s9]#crowded in, but seating them will have to be #[.s1]#determined along the course of role-playing.
The #[.s5]#seats are built to support the frames of anthropomorph #personas.

[.s14]#*Cargo*:#[.s1]#Cargo can be listed as a flat number, and this is the number of tonnes that the vehicle #[.s5]#can safely transport.
If cargo is listed as &#8216;per pass&#8217;
#[.s9]#then there is that amount of cargo space per #[.s1]#passenger that the vehicle was designed for.
A 4 #[.s2]#passenger vehicle with a 10 kg per pass.
cargo #[.s4]#listing would have 40 kg of cargo space.
Exceeding #cargo space should increase DD on the driving [.s2]#performance table.#

[table id=861 /]

=== 1) Cargo {.p4}

Cargo vehicles have [.s1]#a basic design that is devoted to the transport of #[.s5]#things other than passengers.
Roll on Table 54.2, #[.s1]#+++<i>+++Cargo Vehicle Type +++</i>+++to determine the size of the #[.s5]#cargo vehicle.
The passenger portion of this vehicle #[.s2]#is secondary to the cargo space.
The passenger #[.s1]#cabin may, or may not, have access to the cargo #hold.

=== [.s18]#2) Leisure # {.p23}

[.s9]#The leisure #[.s1]#vehicle is the kind of vehicle which we are most familiar.
These are privately owned vehicles that #[.s10]#are designed for commuting to work, pleasure #[.s4]#touring, or simply for parking in front of the house.
#[.s5]#They designed primarily for passenger travel, and have little space allotted for cargo.
Roll on Table #[.s9]#54.3: Leisure Vehicle Type to determine the #[.s1]#dimensions of the leisure vehicle.#

[table id=863 /]+++<figure id="attachment_5355" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5355" style="width: 206px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i1.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/passeger_vehicle-206x300.png?resize=206%2C300[Where toad sir?,206]](https://i2.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/passeger_vehicle.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5355" class="wp-caption-text">+++Where toad sir?+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

=== [.s22]#3) Passenger# {.p28}

[.s23]#The #[.s9]#passenger vehicles are anthropomorph cargo #[.s1]#vehicles.
They have many seats, and reasonable #[.s4]#cargo space for the passenger&#8217;s belongings.
Roll on #[.s1]#Table 54.4: Passenger Vehicle Type to determine #[.s5]#the size of the vehicle.#

[table id=864 /]+++<figure id="attachment_5357" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5357" style="width: 219px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i1.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/darthpogo.592-219x300.png?resize=219%2C300[Skate boards are legal.,219]](https://i1.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/darthpogo.592.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5357" class="wp-caption-text">+++Skate boards are legal.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

=== [.s14]#4) Self Powered# {.p30}

[.s1]#These are #[.s2]#the engineless modes of transportation that the #[.s1]#persona can use to get from one place to another.
#[.s2]#Self powered vehicles function the same as all #[.s5]#other vehicles, except they employ gear systems, #pulleys and elastics to power the vehicle.
These are [.s5]#not your ordinary self powered vehicles since they can attain tremendous speeds.
Roll on Table 54.5: #[.s3]#Self Powered Vehicle Type to determine the type of #[.s5]#powered vehicle.#+++<figure id="attachment_9855" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9855" style="width: 207px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i2.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/non_powered_vehicles_antennae-207x300.jpg?resize=207%2C300[The Hand of Zei by Lyon Sprague De Camp 1950 Illustration Edd Cartier.,207]](https://i2.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/non_powered_vehicles_antennae.jpg)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-9855" class="wp-caption-text">+++Self powered with antennae.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

[table id=865 /]

== 2) Secondary Use {.p36}

The secondary use of a vehicle is far more relevant [.s1]#to the vehicle&#8217;s present state.
This roll indicates the major adaptations carried out on the vehicle #[.s4]#after its initial manufacture.
For instance a leisure #vehicle may be designed for high performance, a [.s5]#military attache vehicle, or purely for recreation.
#[.s8]#The adaptations not only indicate haphazard #[.s10]#adjustments, but changes which are reflected #[.s5]#throughout the entire vehicle.
Roll once on Table #[.s9]#54.6: Secondary Use to determine what the #[.s1]#vehicle&#8217;s secondary format is.#

[table id=866 /]

=== [.s28]#1) High Performance#

[.s5]#High #[.s2]#performance vehicles are generally souped up, #[.s10]#chromed out, rubber melters.
The vehicles are #devoted to speed, acceleration, range, and/or [.s6]#maneuverability.
Any vehicle in this class #automatically receives +10% on acceleration, +20% [.s3]#on speed, and +2 on maneuverability.
These vehicle #[.s4]#parameters are going to be determined later in this chapter.
High performance vehicles get 1-3 rolls on #[.s5]#Table 54.7: High Performance__.__#

[table id=867 /]

=== [.s18]#2) Industrial# {.p46}

[.s9]#Industrial #[.s1]#vehicles are designated for commercial use.
They #[.s2]#are often the simplest vehicles to operate since they are expected to be used by many different #[.s5]#workers.
The referee can certainly make exceptions #to this.
The industrial accessories listed in this section [.s5]#are self explanatory (I hope).
Their size and power #[.s4]#is determined by the size and wate of the vehicle to #[.s1]#which they are attached.
E.g., a shovel attached to a semi-trailer, will certainly move more earth (or #whatever) than a shovel mounted on a skateboard.

Inevitably these wonder sounding attachments will be desired as weapons.
Clearly there are no combat attributes listed for these devices.
Considering they are all industrial devices they have a collection of advanced safety features built in.
This will protect the personas from accidents and it will also keep the device from being used in combat.
Since these industrial devices are not combat ready they would suffer http://expgame.com/?page_id=286[serious damage] if they were used in combat.

[.s1]#Industrial vehicles roll deci-dice to determine how many rolls they get on Table 54.8: Industrial #[.s5]#Accessory+++<i>+++.
+++</i>+++On the first roll there is a 100% chance #[.s1]#of getting an accessory, the next time there is a 50% of getting a second, then there is a 25% chance of #[.s5]#getting a third accessory, this continues until the #[.s10]#player fails a roll, or has 8 accessories for her #[.s1]#vehicle.#

[table id=869 /]+++<figure id="attachment_5356" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5356" style="width: 207px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i2.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tank.587-207x300.png?resize=207%2C300[Tanks for the ride.,207]](https://i2.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tank.587.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5356" class="wp-caption-text">+++Tanks for the ride.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

=== [.s28]#3) Military# {.p60}

[.s5]#Military vehicles #[.s10]#are built tougher than other vehicles.
Damage #[.s3]#rolls to military vehicles have 1/2 effect.
E.g., a 60% #[.s1]#reduction of speed due to vehicle damage, would #[.s2]#only be a 30% reduction on a military vehicle.
#[.s5]#Military vehicles are also eligible for specialized #[.s6]#accessories listed on Table 54.9: Military #[.s5]#Accessory+++<i>+++.
+++</i>+++Military class vehicles get 1-3 rolls on #[.s2]#this table.
The devices are integrated into the vehicle.
They cannot be removed for on foot use.
It would require a skilled mechanic indeed to scavenge an internally mounted gun and still have it work (DD 18).#

[table id=870 /]

=== [.s28]#4) Recreational# {.p4}

[.s5]#This vehicle #[.s1]#class usually sports the typical R.V.
equipment #[.s5]#found in any respectable camper (Table 54.10: Recreational Accessory).
All recreational #[.s1]#vehicles get 1 roll on __ __per 20 passengers.
#

[table id=871 /]

== 3) Speed {.p76}

[.s4]#Speed refers to the maximum speed that the vehicle #can attain, it is no indication of safe driving speed.
[.s10]#The maximum speed can , be generated under virtually any conditions, except maybe during #[.s5]#extreme head winds, or whenever else the ref sees #[.s2]#fit.
Minimum speed is anywhere between 0 h/u #[.s1]#and the maximum speed.
All vehicles may move 50% of their speed in reverse, if the ref feels that this value should be altered she may do so.
Speed #[.s3]#is rolled on 6d12s, all summed.
This is the vehicle&#8217;s #[.s1]#maximum speed in h/u.
For convenience: 1 h/u =1 m/s;
1 h/u = 3.6 kmh;
1 h/u = 2.2 mph#

*[.s2]#Maximum Vehicle Speed#*

*[.s5]#6 x d12 hexes per unit (h/u)#*+++<figure id="attachment_5358" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5358" style="width: 206px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i2.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Acceleration-206x300.png?resize=206%2C300[More faster each unit.,206]](https://i0.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Acceleration.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5358" class="wp-caption-text">+++More faster each unit.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== 4) Acceleration {.p80}

[.s5]#Acceleration indicates how much faster the vehicle #[.s37]#can travel from one unit to the next.
A high #[.s4]#acceleration can indicate the power of the engine in #[.s1]#relation to the wate of the vehicle, basically the #[.s8]#higher the acceleration the more powerful the #engine.
Acceleration generally requires arithmetic.
There are some obvious errors here in this chapter regarding acceleration.
Use the acceleration of the vehicle as a comparison between t0 vehicles and all should be well(ish).

[.s5]#The acceleration of a vehicle represents the #maximum possible acceleration that the vehicle is [.s2]#capable of.
This acceleration can be attained as #long as the contact medium can handle it (grade is [.s8]#sturdy enough, atmosphere is dense enough).
#[.s1]#Vehicles can accelerate at any rate less than the #[.s37]#maximum.
The acceleration of a vehicle is #[.s1]#determined by summing 10d20, and dividing the #[.s5]#total by 10.
The number generated (between 1 and #[.s1]#20) is the vehicle&#8217;s acceleration in h per unit squared.#

[.s5]#A vehicle with an acceleration of 5 h/u2 will #[.s1]#move 5 h/u in the first unit, 10 h/u in the second #[.s5]#unit, and 15 h/u in the third unit.
The vehicle can #[.s2]#increase its speed until it reaches its maximum #[.s1]#speed, at which point it can accelerate no further.#

*[.s2]#Maximum Acceleration#*

*(10xd20)/10 hexes per unit squared (h/u^2^)*

== 5) Locomotion {.p78}

[.s4]#The locomotion of a vehicle is the external extension #[.s5]#of the drive train, it is what acts on the environment #[.s4]#to create movement.
Typical locomotion types are #[.s5]#wheels, tracks, and propellers.[.s8]#If the ref cannot come up with a pseudo#[.s4]#scientific explanation of how the locomotion works #[.s1]#(most referees would have difficulty explaining how a combustion engine works, let alone anti-#[.s2]#gray) black boxing it should  shut them up&#8230;er #[.s1]#pacify them.
#If the ref does not #[.s9]#desire vehicles capable of three dimensional #[.s2]#movement potentially airborne vehicles can be #[.s5]#given a ceiling of 1 meter off of the ground.
This #[.s4]#could be done for anti grav, propeller, or jet propelled #[.s5]#locomotion types.#

Self Powered vehicles do not have a locomotion type.

[.s1]#The speed of the vehicle helps determine the #[.s1]#locomotion type.
Roll on the relevant column of #[.s2]#Table 54.11: Locomotion Type+++<i>+++.
+++</i>+++For example, a vehicle that can move 30 h/u would roll on the #[.s10]#middle column, while one that moves 200 h/u #[.s1]#would roll on the rightmost column.
Table 54.12: Secondary Locomotion Type#[.s4]#__ __is used for special types of locomotion.
For instance, a set of jets may #[.s3]#propel the the vehicle on wheels, or may be the sole source of locomotion.#+++<figure id="attachment_9619" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9619" style="width: 271px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[.size-medium.wp-image-9619] image::https://i2.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/cargo_vehicle-271x300.png?resize=271%2C300[Name: Benett, Léon Dates: 1839-1917 Country: France ILLUSTRATION Subject: Science & technology Technique: Wood engraving Engraver: Moller, F.

[.s1]#[table id=872 /]#

[table id=873 /]

=== 1) Anti Grav

Antigrav is a classic science fiction term for anti-gravity.
This vehicle can travel about as though gravity has no effect upon it.
The vehicle has no obvious external mechanisms that assist its buoyancy in the sky.
As ideal as anti grav is, it will only function within a gravity well.
If antigrav has appeared as  Secondary Locomotion Type, then the vehicle is considered to be buoyant but some other form of locomotion gives the robot direction.

=== 2) Chemical slide

This vehicle tips on its axis, oozes some slippery goo underneath and along it slides.
This process leaves a quickly evaporating trail behind it similar to a slug's.
This comparison does not necessarily imply the vehicle will be slow.
A chemical slide will operate just as well up a slope as down a slope.
Sand, stairs and other difficult terrain may prove to be a challenge for this locomotive type.
How difficult such travel is depends entirely on the referee.
When a chemical slide is from the Secondary Locomotion Table it is offering a frictionless surface on which the primary locomotive type (sails, propellers or jets) is producing the power and direction.

=== 3) Electromagnetic legs

Electromagnetic legs are visible beams of force which support the vehicle at a constant height above the ground.
There are 1 to 4 electromagnetic legs.
Electromagnetic legs adjust for terrain by altering their height and generated force.
This form of locomotion keeps the vehicle level for all but the most unstable terrain.
Electromagnetic legs will not allow the vehicle to travel across liquids.
The legs generate force on the surface which supports the robot and cannot extend the robot more than 1 metre (half a hex) off of the ground.

=== 4) Jets

Vehicle jets are intake-less and do not eject dangerous super-heated propellants.
There are 2 to 5 jets (d4 plus 1).
The jets offer substantial thrust to push and direction.
Jets are often attached to vehicles that have wheels, skis or chemical slides.
Regardless of what the robot slides along on, all jets will function equivalently.

=== 5) Magnetics

A magnetic locomotion unit allows the vehicle to hover above the ground and effortlessly float along.
The height of the vehicle is fixed at no higher than 1 hex.
This locomotion type resembles antigrav in most regards except that magnetic will only work above a solid surface.
A vehicle with magnetic locomotion will often float around long after it has been destroyed.

=== 6) Pistons

High-speed pistons alternately poke up and down keep the vehicle moving.
There are 1 to 10 pistons.
A single piston will cause the vehicle to appear to be riding a single pogo stick.
The timing of the pistons is so immaculately integrated that a passenger will not notice and remains as steady as any other locomotive type.

=== 7) Pods

Pods are the mechanical legs that are expected to be found on robots, but in this case on a vehicle.
There are 4 to16 pods.
Bots that have these articulated poles will either hop, scuttle or patter from one place to another.

=== 8) Propellers

Vehicle propellers are quiet, high-powered and safely encased air screws that can direct the vehicle to give it acceleration in its chosen direction.
There are 1 to 6 propellers.
Depending on the Secondary Locomotion Type, the propellers may push the vehicle about on a set of wheels, along a chemical slide or through the air on antigrav.

=== 9) Sails

Sails are very sturdy, molecular chain planes.
The vehicle locomotion system alters the sails electromagnetically to allow only those air molecules which are travelling parallel to the desired direction to strike the sail.
There are 1 to 3 sails.
Between these very selective filtering and computerized tacking procedures, the vehicle can achieve speeds that are equivalent to any other locomotive type.
The sails may be used to drive the robot along on its wheels or through the air on its antigrav, depending on the Secondary Locomotion Type roll.
The durability of the sales makes them almost impossible to tear and they can only be damaged in combat if the vehicle&#8217;s locomotion is damaged.

=== 10) Skis

The skis are attached to articulated pods that can drive them over almost any type of terrain.
There are 3 to 6 (1d4 plus 2) skis.
The skis operate like cross-country skis and they can travel up a slope as easily as down a slope.
There is no difference in speed whether the vehicle is trotting uphill or sliding down slopes.
When skis are a Secondary Locomotion Type, they are attached to articulated pods and not powered legs.
The skis would be the surface contact but jets, sails or propellers would drive them.

=== 11) Slog bag

A slog bag appears as a flexible, fluid filled sack that is attached to the undercarriage of the vehicle.
The slog bag maintains an even balance by undulating and contorting itself along the surface it is travelling.
The slog bag moves like a sack of mercury might, although there is no reason that it has to contain a liquid.
The slog bag cannot be punctured during regular combat unless the vehicle&#8217;s locomotion is damaged.

=== 12) Tracks

Tracks are nothing more than rubber-coated tank tracks.
There are 1 to 6 tracks.
This form of locomotion is rugged, although not especially graceful.
A single tracked vehicle can change direction by altering the tension on one side of the track versus the tension of the other side.

=== 13) Wheels

Wheels are singularly powered, axle-less and have solid tires.
A vehicle could have any number of wheels and it could even be a unicycle.
There are 1 to 12 wheels.
If the wheels are a secondary locomotion type they non-powered wheels.
The Primary Locomotion Type (sails, jets, propellers etc) generates the force.

=== 14) Balloons

These balloons can inflate and deflate rapidly.
Changing the density of the gas inside the balloon.
These alterations in buoyancy are used to propel the vehicle forward.
If there is a secondary locomotion type there may be a single balloon for lift and the thrust and direction will come from propellers or what ever.

== 6) Engine Type {.p82}

[.s5]#Similar to the locomotion, the engine type is #[.s1]#run as a black box.
The engine types are run so much like black boxes that the only thing which separates them is the fuel that goes into them.
All #[.s2]#the engines require refitting of some sort: solar #[.s10]#cells burn out;
coils get demagnetized;
rubber #[.s1]#bands wind down;
and fuel tanks empty.#

[.s10]#Engine parts are compatible provided that #[.s1]#the engines use the same fuel, are the same tech #[.s4]#level, and have roughly the same power output (an #[.s9]#engine block for a semi-trailer would not be #[.s3]#compatible with that of a mini).
For mechanics that #[.s11]#attempt bizarre engine repairs, the ref must #[.s1]#remember that the less compatible the parts, the higher the DD.
The vehicle&#8217;s engine type can be #determined on Table 54.13: [.s8]#Engine Type__.
__If you are needing more information about the fuel types refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=239#7-power-source[robotic powers source] for more details.#

[table id=874 /]

== [.s1]#7) Maneuverability# {.p76}

[.s1]#The maneuverability of a vehicle represents the combination of steering capacity, brake response, tire traction, chassis balance, etc.
These elements all tie into one number, called the handling level.
#[.s6]#The handling level is used on the http://expgame.com/?page_id=277[Driving]#[.s1]#http://expgame.com/?page_id=277[Performance] Table the same as a persona&#8217;s skill #[.s5]#level is used on the Skill Performance Table.
The higher the handling level the better the chance of #success on the Driving Performance table, and thus the better control of the vehicle.
The base handling [.s3]#level is decided on Table 54.14: Handling Level__.__ #

[table id=875 /]

== [.s16]#8) Accessories# {.p103}

[.s9]#Table 54.15: Accessories organizes#[.s4]# all the accessories imaginable for vehicles #onto one simple table.
The roll can add junk, [.s2]#but character, to a vehicle, or it could turn the #vehicle into a spectacular machine.
All vehicles get [.s3]#one roll on the General Accessory Table.
#

[.s3]#Table 54.16,: #[.s2]#Junk Accessory requires no explanation.
#[.s1]#Table 54.17: Normal Accessory and Table #[.s5]#54.18: Special Accessory will alter #[.s1]#the vehicle in a beneficial manner.
Some of the #[.s2]#effects are straight forward, as in double cargo #[.s5]#space.
While other vehicle modifications are left to #[.s1]#the interpretation of the referee.
The main reason #for this lack of definition is that the accessories can [.s41]#be attached to anything, and the required #[.s5]#adjustments for vehicle size, type, locomotion, etc.
are not economical for this chapter.
Vehicles that #[.s4]#have been &#8216;tested&#8217;
for a particular environment can #[.s2]#operate in it without penalties.#

[table id=876 /]

[table id=877 /]

[table id=878 /]

[table id=879 /]

== 9) Adaptability {.p82}

[.s5]#This optional feature of a vehicle represents how readily it accepts new parts.
These parts could be #[.s2]#replacements, or whole rr(t accessories.
A DD #[.s4]#penalty is assigned to each vehicle indicating how #[.s1]#adaptable it is.
High performance vehicles are harder to adapt and add 3DD to anyone working on them.
Industrial vehicles on the other hand are open to refits and have a -5DD adjustment.
Military and recreational vehicles have no change in DD of repairs or adaptation.#

== 10) Wate {.p37}

[.s4]#The wate of a vehicle is recorded in kilograms or tonnes.
The #[.s2]#wate can be important for crashes;
for crossing #[.s4]#terrain;
for vehicular transport;
or for running over #[.s1]#things.
The base wate given in the vehicle format #[.s5]#can be increased by attaching accessories, or filling #[.s1]#in cargo holds.
For those very large accessories, particularly the industrial ones, assume that they #[.s3]#are 25 % of the wate of the vehicle which they were #[.s5]#assigned to.#

== 11) Size {.p37}

[.s1]#The specific proportions of a vehicle will not be #[.s9]#considered, but the rough area (or volume if #[.s2]#necessary) is recorded in hexes.
A vehicle will #occupy one hex per 200 kg of vehicle wate.
These [.s2]#hexes can be arranged in whatever manner seen #[.s10]#fit, depending on the appearance, and primary #[.s5]#format of the vehicle.#
