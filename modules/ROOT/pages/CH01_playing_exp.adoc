= Playing EXP

The first introduction to EXP was very long.
There were very few role-playing games.
There was no internet.
There were no cell phones.
There were no laptops.
Very few people knew what an "RPG" was, and those that did fear them.
Much of the first introduction explained how EXP fits into society.
Today there are thousands of role-playing games.
They can be played on tabletops.
They can be played on computer screens.
They can be played on phones.
They can be played in virtual reality.
Today "RPG" means role-playing game and not a rocket-propelled grenade.

== What does EXP mean?
The initial working title of the game was EXP1000.
EXP stood for EXPerimental, EXPerience points and EXPeditions.
EXPerience points were awarded for story and role-playing. 
It was unique at the time to award experience for anything other than combat success.
EXPeditions were formed instead of parties.
1000 represented using a 1000 sided die in combat.
EXP1000 was shortened to EXP.
Then EXP was lengthened to EXP  The game of technological chaos. 
This headline was to reflect the randomness of the TOY system.

== Why do such a thing?
EXP was done because it was not there.
There was only a game called Dungeons and Dragons. 
The tiny booklets were incomplete.
We were avid fans of science fiction.
Science fiction was limited to books, broadcast television and theatres.
The company called TSR released two games by the same author (James Ward).
These were Metamorphosis Alpha and Gamma World.
We loved the concepts but not the rules.

EXP1000 was entirely derivative from those two games.
As players, we used miniatures on hex paper to sort out combat.
Our combat was highly influenced by the meticulous war games of the day.
Combat resolution was tactical, detailed, and obsessive.
A twenty-sided die was not refined enough for us.
We simulated a one thousand sided die by rolling three ten sides.
This allowed us to give subtle bonuses or penalties.

== EXP as a reference book
In the 1980s role-playing games became and industry. 
Publishing houses needed to create content to sell and stay afloat.
This practice involved breaking games into parts and making supplements.
EXP chose to not follow this path at all.

. Create a generic sciency fiction role-playing game.
. Create one book that contained all content.
. Wait decades for this internet thing to catch on.

Initially EXP was a book. 
Books were very expensive to print.
Technology has advanced and we no longer have to print a 777 page book.
The intertubes and open source licensing has allowed EXP to be available to all.
This version is a rewrite and a move to technologies that will allow EXP to grow.

EXP is no longer a book but a living document that will:

. Be kept in a versioned repository
. Be free and open source
. Allow for multiple authors
. Be downloadable as a book or website

== Newbies
This used to be labelled Neophytes.
There were explanations of how to start a group etc.
Role-playing games are everywhere today.
To get started simply ask around.
You are guaranteed to find like minded folks.
They are unlikely to be playing EXP.
Better to start off with some friends rather than complete strangers.
Be safe and have fun.

== Concerned Parents
This section was originally written during a moral panic surrounding role-playing games (RPGs). 
Today parents are concerned if their kids are *not* playing RPGs.
Entire families play together. 
RPGs have been shown to improve numeracy, literacy, creativity and social skills.
A parent today would simply buy, download or create an RPG and start playing with their kids.

== RPG style of EXP
EXP, the game of technological chaos, is a sciency fiction role-playing game. 
While EXP has many detailed resolution systems, it is not particularly serious.
The base ruleset is written with the most detailed solutions in mind.
Most of the resolution systems allow for spectacular successes and failures.
The rule sets are flexible, generic, and interoperable.
There are always more straightforward, faster and possibly more fun ways to resolve the story.

A humanoid gorilla, a robot and a tentacled alien walk into a bar...
That bar is on a space ship that is being chased by a school bus full of mutants.
The gorilla fires her laser rifle at the school bus.
The tentacled alien spits poison at the driver.
The robot fires up her electronic countermeasures.
All the personas could use their mutations against each other.
The space vehicle fires it's naval cannon at the school bus.
The combat session is suddenly over.

All of these elements are integrated into one ruleset.

== EXP is silly
Role-playing is supposed to be fun.
EXP is not hard science. 
EXP is pseudo-science, sciency fiction or even silly science.
The families, rules and technology are ironic and border on the ridiculous.
The element of randomness is endemic in all of EXP's rules.
Personas and technology are generated randomly.
EXP has been waiting for decades for the computer support it needed.
This random factor ensures that EXP proudly crosses the border of ridiculousness.
EXP wallows in the pink and green light of the absurd.
There will be nuclear-powered toasters, combat robots with welcome mats, and fun-loving aliens.

// nature and depth of randomness
== EXP is Very Random
Personas are determined randomly.
The players adapt to their random personas.
Technological equipment is determined randomly.
The technological level of equipment is determined randomly.
Players have to figure out what equipment is.
Mutations are applied randomly.
The game has a whole lot of dice rolling that is best suited for computer assistance.
There is no computer assistance.

// how are personas made
== Personas
The player may choose from three different families: anthropomorphs, aliens and robots. 
Most players will be limited to playing the familiar anthro family.
Beyond choosing family the personas are determined randomly.
Typical RPG attributes are generated on 3d6.
The attributes are used to determine the type and vocation of the persona.
Mutations can be randomly added and include defects and special powers.
Each persona is assigned some random equipment that may be junk or valuable.

== Vocations
EXP has vocations that have a set of skills and possibly even ideals.
The vocations the player can choose from are determined by their attributes.
Players can make up skills and challenge a performance table to determine success.
The chance of success increases as the persona's gather experience points.

== Experience points
Players collect experience points for their personas.
These can be collected by participating in combat, roleplaying well, or being funny.

== Technology
Any tech level device can appear simultaneously with any other tech level device.
The higher the tech level, the smaller, lighter and more dependable the device.
Higher tech level items can be hard to recognize.
Very low tech level items can also be hard to recognize. 
It is possible for high and low tech level versions of the same item to co-exist.

== Combat system
The combat system is based on attack rolls and damage represented by hit points.
There are multiple combat systems to work with. 
Tactical is the most complex and is considered the game standard.
The tactical combat system uses a d1000 attack roll.
There also is a theatrical combat system.
The theatrical system is derived from the tactical system.
The theatrical system is faster.

== EXP has no story
EXP is not a milieu. 
The game is a rule set, and players are supposed to create their own worlds and stories.
This is intentional.

== Her, him, huh?
During one of EXP's versions, it was noted that there was a lack of women involved in RPGs.
Without any future knowledge of the coming pronoun revolution, EXP moved from he to her.
The simple argument was that both her and she included he.
Inclusive and more comfortable to write.
