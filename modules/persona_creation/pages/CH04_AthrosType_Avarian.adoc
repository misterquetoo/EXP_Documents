This anthro type is also known as Homo Avis.
Avarians usually have beaks for mouths, feathers for hair, down covered skin and eyes where our ears would normally be.
An avarian can be modeled after any bird: hawk, parrot, albatross, ostrich, penguin, vulture, swallow, puffin, robin, etc.
Homo Avis are bipedal humanoids that naturally possesses no abilities other than those listed here.
For example, avarians cannot fly.

Avarians are generally wingless; however, there is a 30% chance of an avarian having decorative wings in addition to down covered arms.
These residual wings will not hamper the persona in any way; however, they are nothing more than decorative.
Of those avarians which randomly attain wings, 20% of those can fly.
Players that insist on having wings for their avarian personas have a 2% chance of being able to fly.
These percentage chances are commonly determined by rolling deci-dice, where the lower the roll the more likely they are of occurring.

Flying avarians are able to fly at up to double their regular movement rate.
Those avarians which are capable of flight also suffer a -2 h/u movement rate penalty when they are walking on the ground.
Those avarians that have the ground movement penalty cannot have a movement rate less than 1 h/u.
An avarian with a 16 DEX would have a 6 h/u as determined on the <em>movement table</em> in chapter 3 (Attributes).
If this avarian also had functioning wings, she could fly at 12 h/u and run at 4 h/u.
For more information about movement rates, see Chapter 12: Time and Movement.

Avarians are flighty, nervous and aware of their surroundings.
This is the basis of their ambush detection bonus of being able to use three times their AWE to detect ambushes.
This is something that players should frequently remind their referee about in order to ensure that the detection ability is always employed.
For further information, see Chapter 34: Ambush.
