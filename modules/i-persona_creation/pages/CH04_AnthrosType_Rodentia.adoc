|===

Rodentia is short for Hominidae Homo Rodens.
Rodentia are humanoid rat people.
Rodentia can appear as: beaver, kangaroo, rat, mouse, mole, porcupine, hedgehog, gopher, platypus, hamster, gerbil, squirrel, etc.
Every rodentia has two arms, two legs, a torso and a face.
Rodentia are fur covered humanoids with paws, rodent heads and tails.
Rodents have none of the powers of their chosen type.
For example, a rodentia beaver cannot chew their own timber and a platypus would not be poisonous.

== Speedy
Rodents can move fast and are uninhibited by terrain.
All rodentia get a movement bonus of +20%.
So a rodent that has a 5 h/u move would now move at 6 h/u.
Rodents are unaffected by familiar terrain.
So if a rodent is running through thick grass she would not suffer any movement penalty.

== Night Vision
Rodentia have a limited night vision.
The night vision does not work if artificial light is present. 
For example, a torch or searchlight would disable rodent night vision.
In complete darkness a rodent can see 2 hexes per point of Awareness. 
A rodentia with AWE 12 could see 24 hexes as if darkness is daytime.
