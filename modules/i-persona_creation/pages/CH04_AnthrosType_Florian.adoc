Florians are also known as Homo Planta.
The florians are walking plants which will usually have bark for skin and fungus or leaves for hair.
All florians have a humanoid shape with many types of decorations to choose from: petunia, rose, seaweed, pine cones, etc.
Remember that these various florian types are merely decorations for upright humanoids and they have no abilities other than those listed here.
For example, a florian persona modelled after poison ivy would not be untouchable.
However, a florianâ€™s charisma could be so low that she is treated like poison ivy.
Florians do not have any special prowess at hiding amongst the flora either.
