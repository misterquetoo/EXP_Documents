= Time and Movement

This section is devoted to non-combat time and movement.
The Roll Playing System's Tactical Combat is meticulous about time and movement.
Time is played out in 2 second chunks called units.
Movement is recorded using tokens and hexagon covered mats.
This meticulous time and space keeping is only used in the Tactical Combat System.

When persona's lives are not on the line game time passes as a convenience.
