= Performance Rolls

Performance Rolls are made by players when their persona is attempting a maneuver.
A Performance Roll is required when the persona is trying to do something. 
For example, strapping a grommet-sized oscillating refractometer onto a Frederickson di-collating time re-modulator.
Or steering a hover jeep for the first time. 
With a single die roll, the player skips directly to the aftermath of her persona's attempt.

The more difficult the maneuver the higher the player needs to roll.
The difficulty of the maneuver is indicated the Degree of Difficulty (DD).
The Degree of Difficulty can be determined from a vocation skill list, randomly or arbitrarily by the referee.

The player rolls a 1d100 to determine success or failure of the maneuver. 
The player wants to roll high.
Sometimes a maneuver will be too difficult for the persona to complete on their own. 

Performance Rolls are part of the Roll Playing system.
A less complicated approach to skills and maneuvers is found in the Role Playing System.

NOTE: *The Performance Roll system replaces Performance Tables from previous versions.*

== Determine Skill Level
The Skill Level is a combination of the persona's EXPS Level and her skills.
A persona can use her EXPS Level for any maneuver that fits within her vocation.
If the persona also has an applicable skill she can add this to her Skill Level.
Persona's attempting maneuvers outside of their vocation have a skill level of zero.

=== Calculating Skill Level
.Skill Level = EXPS Level + Applicable SKill
****
A third level biologist with Herbivore 2 would have a skill level of 5 studying herbivores.
****

== Determine Degree of Difficulty
The more difficult something is to do the higher the Degree of Difficulty (DD).
Most of the time the DD is clearly define by the maneuver in the personas vocation skill list.
Any persona can attempt anything.
However the DD can be so high that it is impossible to make the Performance Roll.
From the biologist skill table Cloning is DD 42. 
From the driving maneuver table driving straight ahead is DD 1.
The lowest DD possible is 1.
There is no upper limit to a how high a DD can go.

Circumstances can increase or decrease the DD of a maneuver.

Degree of Difficulty can also be determined by a description of the maneuver.
The description is usually assigned by the referee, but negotiation is possible.
Described Degree of Difficulty is for maneuvers that are not on any list. 
Player will always be coming up with creative challenges for their personas.
A trivial maneuver has a DD of 1.
An impossible maneuver has a DD ranging from 21 to 30 and is randomly rolled.

Referees are also allowed to arbitrarily decide a Degree of Difficulty based on the Descriptor.

== Determine Target Roll
The target roll is like the armour rating of a procedure.
The player must roll equal to or higher than the target roll.
The target roll is determined by Skill Level and Degree of Difficulty.
The higher the skill level the lower the target roll.
The higher the DD the higher the target roll.

The target roll can be calculated or tabulated.
The table is collection of common target rolls pre-calculated for your look up pleasure. 
Very high skill levels and very high DDs will require calculation.

=== Calculated
The skill level bonus increases as the persona's level increases.
Higher EXPS levels have an even greater bonus per EXPS level.

=== Target Roll Calculation
.Roll = 56 + 4 per DD - Skill
****
Must roll 80 or higher to beat a DD6 maneuver with 0 Skill. +
Must roll 50 or higher to beat a DD6 maneuver with 10 Skill.
****

=== Tabulated Target Roll
No calculations compare DD to skill to get Target Roll.

== Determine Bonuses
Bonuses are added to the player's 1d100 roll.
Bonuses will often mean the difference between success and failure.
Bonuses can come from every which way.
There are TOYs that give Performance Roll bonuses.
There are computers that give Performance Roll bonuses.
Many referees will offer Performance Roll bonuses for good role playing descriptions.

=== Attribute Bonuses
The most common bonuses are vocation attribute bonuses.
If the maneuver fits into the vocation's aptitude the player can add an attribute to 1d100 roll.
For combat maneuvers mercenaries can add their PSTR.
For knowledge based maneuvers biologists can add their INT. 

include::ROOT:partial$CH14_Table_Vocation_Bonus.adoc[]

=== Role Playing Bonuses
The more role playing is integrated into the roll playing system the more fun the play is.
Role playing is incentivised in Performance Rolls by awarding roll bonuses for fun descriptions.
For example, the player that says, “I’m going to leaf through my notes here, and try to identify this bizarre creature” before making the Performance Roll should get some bonus.
Or “I summon all the forces of evil beneath me, as I try to apply pressure to this weakling altruist.”
Or “Taking my favorite tools from my mechanical kit, I proceed to repair this damaged bicycle.”
Or “I  calmly stalk silently past the sleeping sentry.”

The bonuses should be small.
For example, +5 added to the Performance Roll would be generous bonus.
Small bonuses that lead to success generate quite a bit of excitement.

== Roll 1d100
The player rolls the 1d100, adds in the bonuses and hopes to beat the target roll. 
Any roll equal to or higher than the target roll is a success.
Any roll less than the target roll is a failure.

There are critical checks on Performance Rolls.
A roll of 100 can mean a success in the face of an impossible task.
A roll of 01 can indicated a failure in the face of certain victory.






== Vocations and  Maneuvers 
Occasionally a persona will wish to attempt a maneuver that is clearly from another class's skill set.
For example, mercenaries often find themselves wanting to do quick fixes and stabilizations (vet).
A mechanic may want to work on a security system (spie).
These are not research team maneuvers.
The Cross Class Maneuver Penalty Table.
If a player is trying to use the Cross Class Maneuver Table to game the system, like a mechanic trying to use knite skills, or a mercenary trying to do a major surgery the referee is free to assign degree of difficulty modifiers, and critical successes (rolling 100) would result in unintended consequences.

include::ROOT:partial$CH14_Table_Cross_Class_Maneuvers.adoc[]


== Required Equipment 
Why is it so difficult for personas to perform class skills?
The reason is simple: they are operating with virtually their bare hands.
The various class performance tables indicate the chance of success when operating with a bare minimum of equipment  that is, with what is listed on Table 14.2: Minimum Equipment.
+Some of the minimal equipment requirements are facetious, but others are very serious.
A knite, for instance, must have at least an 18 MSTR to perform any of her psionic tasks.
If a persona is caught without her minimum equipment, the referee may levy appropriate Performance Table roll penalties.

== Research Teams 
Research teams allow groups of personas to pool their experience for a greater chance of success.
Several mechanics may share their expertise to solve a scientific problem, or repair a broken warp drive.
A  team of veterinarians could work  together to save a life.
The experience level of a research team is the sum of the experience levels of its members, and every player gets a PT roll for success using the combined experience level.
If any one of them makes a successful PT roll, then the entire team is successful.

=== Team Composition
Every team will have a team leader.
The team can consist of one persona per level of the team leader.
So a 5 level veterinarian could lead a team of 5 personas.
Teams can be composed of only one class, or mixed between classes.
If a 7th level biologist wanted to create a team to determine whether the indigenous people of a planet were going to revolt she could create a team with 7 biologists plus her self.
She could also form a team with 5 biologists a mercenary and a spie.
Since both a mercenary and a spie could have useful input into the maneuver being made.
Veterinarians regularly form research teams in the operating room.
The team leader might be a 4th level vet, with two 3rd level vets and one 2nd level vet assisting.
A mechanic and spie may work together to create a spie tool.

=== Benefits of Teamwork
The team's collective experience approaches the  task.
The collective level of the team is the total of all the team member's levels.
So an operating room team composed of a 4th level vet (team lead), with two 3rd level vets and one 2nd level vet would have an aggregate experience level of 12.
Not only does the team make the performance roll as a 12th level veterinarian each of the four players on the team get to make a roll.

So the team would have four chances to be successful.
When each persona makes her performance roll she may add any attribute, skill or equipment bonuses to her individual roll.
Even if three players fail their rolls but the 4th roll is successful  the maneuver would be a success.
Research teams can make even the most difficult of medical manoeuvres possible.

=== Experience
The entire team enjoys in the experience earned for the successful maneuver.
How the experience is divided up depends on the referee's choice.
One of the simplest ways is to divide the experience by the number of team members plus one.
Where the one extra share goes to the team lead.



== Duration
How long it takes to complete a task generally depends on a combination of common sense and degree of difficulty, although some skills have specifically assigned durations.
Performing open heart surgery (a difficult task) would always take longer than ten minutes, for instance, while the equally difficult task of a double somersault leap on ice skates would be over for better or worse almost as soon as it began.

The suggested durations are generally minima -- their DD values represent the persona's being rushed, and so the quality of her workmanship cannot be guaranteed.
If the duration of the procedure is important, the persona must first sacrifice the time and only then try to make the PT roll.
A persona working on a project that takes many months may or may not be able to go exploring during this time, and only when the duration is over will she find out if she has succeeded or not.

For example, a biologist trying to determine the armour rating of a particular alien (5 DD) would first roll 5d4 and  is the number of minutes that she must spend leafing through her notes and contemplating before making a decision.
If she is interrupted or stopped during this time, her roll may be penalized or forfeited.If a persona wants to complete some procedure quicker than normal, she can certainly increase the degree of difficulty to decrease the duration spent working on the problem.
The biologist above could certainly try to identify the alien's armour in under a minute, but she would suffer what ever DD penalty the referee felt was appropriate.

Many class abilities take up no time at all, because they represent inherent abilities that must be performed swiftly -- many knite, mercenary, and spie skills, for instance, are performed during combat and require no research or study.
Table 14.1, Research Durations only applies as a rough guide for technical activities which require durations in order to appear more realistic.

include::ROOT:partial$CH14_Table_Duration_of_Research.adoc[]

== Repeat Offenders 
Players will find that there will be certain rolls that are repeated over and over again.
It is up to the referee and players to decide how to manage repeat rolls.
It would certainly be boring to have a lower degree of difficulty roll have to be re rolled over and over again.
For example a merc may not have to challenge her PT roll for weapon switch if she has done it over and over again.
As one would expect if the maneuver has been automated there would be no experience granted.
Any of the higher level degree of difficulty maneuvers should not allow for automation.
A research team can NEVER automate one of their projects.
