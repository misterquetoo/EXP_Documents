[.s3]#Encumbrance #[.s4]#is simply the burden of equipment that the persona has elected to carry.
Everything #that the persona wears or carries is included in [.s5]#encumbrance.
This includes: clothing, armour #[.s4]#(unless worn), ammunition, weapons, food, and #[.s5]#any other utensil with a #[.s6]#wate.
What this chapter does not cover are the subjective quirks of any encumbrance system For example, carrying #[.s4]#enough objects with a negligible wate #[.s7]#could result in significant encumbrance.
The age old questions of #[.s1]#which is more difficult to carry, 2 kgs of #[.s9]#oxygen, or 2 kgs of lead?
Such conundrums are #[.s5]#omitted in this chapter.#

[.s4]#There is an element of qualitative measure for encumbrance in EXP.
If the encumbrance system isn&#8217;t empirical, then why have it at all?
The main reason for the #[.s6]#encumbrance system is to a nod to attempted realism.
#[.s10]#Role-playing games often ignore basic #physiological facts, and encumbrance attempts to deal with one of these.[.s6]# However role playing games shouldn&#8217;t be bogged #[.s9]#down with excessively detailed physics and biology.
What the #[.s4]#encumbrance system hopefully does is represent is a happy #[.s9]#medium between realism, and fun gaming.
A #[.s11]#persona shuffling through the underbrush with 3 tonnes of equipment would not only #[.s4]#be unrealistic, but impossible for the referee to manage.
Equally, players shouldn&#8217;t be burdened with an exacting milligram calculation of their #[.s9]#equipment list.
If encumbrance is being used #[.s6]#frequently enough, the encumbrance system should #[.s7]#become a cursory action, and not a burdensome #[.s5]#chore.#

[.s11]#Rules in #[.s12]#EXP #[.s11]#are to be applied judiciously by #[.s6]#the referee, and encumbrance rules are no different #from any other rules in this game.
If they are [.s7]#becoming a burden then don&#8217;t use them.
Only use what aspects of encumbrance you feel are necessary.#+++<figure id="attachment_1799" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1799" style="width: 217px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i1.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/ecumbrance_hurdle-217x300.png?resize=217%2C300[Free versus over encumbered.,217]](https://i0.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/ecumbrance_hurdle.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-1799" class="wp-caption-text">+++Free versus over encumbered.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== [.s1]#Levels of Encumbrance# {.p6}

[.s6]#Encumbrance is based on the wate allowance of the #[.s4]#persona, and wate allowance (WA) is determined #[.s6]#by the persona&#8217;s PSTR.
How a load effects a persona #[.s4]#may be described by five possible conditions of #[.s13]#encumbrance: #[.s14]#free, unencumbered, #encumbered, over-encumbered, [.s15]#and #lift.
[.s15]#Each #[.s9]#one represents progressively more wate compared to the persona&#8217;s PSTR.#

=== [.s16]#Free# {.p5}

[.s11]#This is a self explanatory heading.
This #[.s5]#is when the persona is free of all encumbering #[.s11]#factors.
The persona cannot be carrying anything,#and even restrictive civilian clothing may jeopardize a persona&#8217;s free standing.
Even carrying a weapon may move a persona from the free encumbrance category

=== [.s18]#Unencumbered# {.p13}

[.s19]#This category of #[.s7]#encumbrance indicates that the persona has some #[.s6]#equipment, maybe a suit of armour, but not enough #[.s5]#equipment to restrict movement and abilities.
A persona is #[.s7]#unencumbered if she is carrying less than #[.s20]#1/4 her #[.s21]#wate allowance (WA)#[.s4]#.
A persona with an #[.s22]#11 PSTR #[.s7]#would have a WA of 16 kgs.
She could carry #[.s4]#up to 4 kgs, and still be unencumbered.#

=== [.s23]#Encumbered# {.p4}

[.s7]#Encumbered is the common#[.s24]# state for most personas to be in.
#[.s7]#Encumbered personas are carrying anywhere from #[.s4]#1/4 to 1 and a 1/2 times their wate allowance (WA).
So the persona with a wate allowance #[.s6]#of 16 kgs could carry up to 24 kgs, and only be #[.s5]#encumbered.
This is the normal range of wate #[.s11]#bearing for the persona, any greater wate will have #[.s4]#a detrimental effect on the function of the persona.#

=== [.s25]#Overencumbered# {.p4}

[.s26]#An over-encumbered #[.s11]#persona is carrying more than 1 and 1/2 times her wate allowance (WA).
#[.s7]#To be exact, she would be carrying between 1 and 1/2 to #[.s4]#2 and 1/2 times her WA.
The persona with the #[.s27]#11 PSTR #[.s26]#would be over encumbered carrying between 24 and 40 kgs of #equipment.

=== [.s23]#Lift Only# {.p14}

[.s7]#When a persona encounters a load #[.s4]#greater than 2 and 1/2 times her wate allowance she cannot move with this wate.
A persona can only lift something that is more than 2 and 1/2 times her #[.s11]#WA.
Before the object, or collection of objects, can #be budged, she must make a successful PSTR [.s7]#attribute roll.
The difficulty of the attribute roll is #[.s5]#determined by the referee (the heavier the load, #[.s11]#the more difficult the attribute roll).
When a #[.s9]#persona is lifting, she can engage in no other #actions.

== [.s1]#Determining Wate Allowance# {.p15}

[.s11]#The wate allowance of the persona is determined #directly by her PSTR.
Each PSTR value has a base wate allowance [.s4]# which is used to calculate all the different encumbrance categories.
Wate allowance is listed with PSTR in Chapter 3: Attributes.
On#[.s4]# #[.s1]#Table 18.1: PSTR Encumbrance#[.s29]# all of the calculations for different encumbrance levels are included.
The #[.s4]#wate allowance is in kilograms.#

[.s4]#[table id=197 /]#

[.s4]#*Robots*: Anthropomorphs, aliens, and the weaker #[.s26]#robots can use the #[.s30]#PSTR #[.s31]#Encumbrance #[.s26]#table #[.s7]#directly;
however, #[.s20]#most #[.s7]#robots will not be able to do #[.s4]#so.
Robotic wate allowance is determined by the bot&#8217;s #[.s32]#PSTR, #[.s4]#like all other races, except that the #[.s11]#resulting WA is multiplied by the tot&#8217;s #[.s22]#PSTR #[.s11]#Level.
#[.s6]#A bot with a #[.s33]#PSTR #[.s6]#of 17, and a #[.s33]#PSTR #[.s6]#Level of 3 would #[.s4]#have a wate allowance of 75 kgs.#[.s4]# Table 18.1 is #[.s11]#overcome by simply multiplying the 3 wate range #[.s4]#partitions by the Psm Level.
For the bot we just #[.s11]#described Free (1/4 WA) would be less than 18.9 kgs (3 x 6.3), Encumbered (1 and #[.s4]#1/2 WA) would be less than 112.5 kgs (3 x 37.5), and Life Only (#2 and 1/2 WA) would be anything greater than 187.5 kgs (3 x 62.5).

*Aliens*: If the thought of gigantic aliens only being able to lift a few hundred kilograms galls you, feel free to adjust the wate allowance according to Table 18.2: Alien Size Wate Allowance Adjustment

== [.s1]#Encumbrance Effects# {.p15}

[.s1]#The encumbrance categories are neat and #[.s11]#interesting, but #[.s34]#how #[.s11]#they affect the performance of #[.s4]#a persona is what really matters.
The remaining #[.s1]#paragraphs describe how being encumbered, and #[.s7]#over-encumbered  the persona&#8217;s overall #[.s1]#efficiency.
All of the tables are optional, but reading #[.s11]#through them should give the impression that the more you carry #[.s34]#the worse off you are.#

[.s18]#*Performance Rolls*:#[.s4]#Carrying too much #[.s11]#equipment has a detrimental effect #[.s7]#on the persona&#8217;s ability to perform class skills#[.s5]#.
Table 18.3 #[.s8]#Encumbrance and Performance Rolls #[.s6]#is included here.
#[.s11]#This table shows what penalty should be added to the degree of difficulty#[.s1]# of the maneuver.
A 6DD maneuver attempted #[.s6]#while encumbered would become a 9DD maneuver.
#[.s4]#If the persona chooses to #[.s31]#dump #[.s26]#her equipment, and #[.s31]#then attempt the maneuver#[.s11]# she will not suffer the performance roll penalty.
A persona cannot dump equipment#[.s6]# during #[.s21]#combat #[.s4]#or where the encumbrance effects are due to #[.s21]#increased gravity.#

[table id=199 /]

[.s37]#*Movement*:#[.s3]#Encumbrance #[.s4]#has its greatest effect on movement.
The greater #[.s11]#the load on the persona, the more difficult it is to #[.s4]#move.
Table 18.4: #[.s21]#Encumbrance and Movement #[.s4]#demonstrates encumbrance effects on movement.
Remember that only #[.s7]#anthros can bolt or sprint.
For more info #[.s4]#about movement refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=265[Chapter 12 Time and Movement].#

[.s18]#[table id=200 /]#

[.s18]#*Initiative*:#[.s4]#No matter how #[.s11]#good a persona&#8217;s DEX, if she&#8217;s loaded down with #[.s4]#equipment, her response time will be hampered.
#[.s11]#The initiative adjustments shown on Table 18.5: #[.s31]#Encumbrance and Initiative, #[.s26]#adjust the #[.s10]#persona&#8217;s response time by her level of #[.s11]#encumbrance.
An overencumbered persona that #[.s1]#rolled 18 on her initiative roll would have it reduced #[.s11]#to 15.
For a detailed explanation of initiative see http://expgame.com/?page_id=310[C]#http://expgame.com/?page_id=310[hapter 33: Initiative].

[.s42]#[table id=201 /]#

[.s42]#*Ambush*:#[.s11]#An over-encumbered persona&#8217;s response to ambush is slower, due to the equipment that is #[.s43]#hampering her reactions.
Over-encumbered #[.s1]#personas act 1 unit slower than all other ambushed #[.s5]#personas.
This means that, unless the persona detected the ambush, she will be subject to an #[.s1]#additional unit of attack before the regular ambush #[.s4]#cycle begins.
Personas encumbered to the point of #[.s7]#lift cannot react to an ambush at all.
The procedures #[.s4]#of ambush are explained in http://expgame.com/?page_id=312[Chapter 34: Ambush].#

[.s42]#*Driving*:#[.s11]#Personas cannot drive a vehicle #[.s5]#unless they are &#8216;free&#8217;
or unencumbered.
If the #[.s4]#persona insists on driving while encumbered or #[.s11]#over-encumbered she will suffer the same penalties on the to her driving performance roll as she would on her performance rolls.
See Table 18.3: Encumbrance and Performance Rolls.#

[.s44]#*Attribute Rolls*:#[.s7]#Rarely will attribute rolls be affected by encumbrance.
If the referee has judged that equipment loads jeopardize attribute rolls the #[.s26]#difficulty of the roll should be made higher.
#[.s7]#Attribute rolls for DEX#[.s20]#, #[.s45]#PSTR, can#[.s7]# occasionally #[.s4]#be affected by encumbrance levels.
For example,#[.s7]# getting #[.s4]#up, balancing, jumping, etc.
Whereas the other #[.s3]#attributes AWE, CHA, INT and MSTR are primarily #[.s7]#non-physical attribute rolls, and are not affected by encumbrance.
See http://expgame.com/?page_id=275[Chapter 16: Special Rolls] for more information about #[.s4]#attribute rolls.
