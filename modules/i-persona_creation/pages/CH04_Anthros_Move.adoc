= Anthro Movement Rate

A persona’s movement rate is determined by her DEX.
Table 3.2 is used to find how fast a persona can move in h/u (equal to m/s).
So a player character with an 11 DEX could move 4 h/u.
This means her figure can be moved 4 spaces (hexes) in one play (unit).
For a more detailed account of movement, refer to Chapter 12.
Time and Movement.

The dexterity attribute is rolled on 3d6 and this makes its range from 3 to 18.
If a persona’s dexterity should happen to fall below 1, she is irrevocably dead due to complete motor-nervous system failure.
