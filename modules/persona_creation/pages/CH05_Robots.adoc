= Robots

:table-caption: Table 5.

For players who want to try something different and more challenging, the Robot section will fit the bill nicely.
Robots are an unusual category of persona for many reasons, the least of which is the fact that they are not biological entities.
This alone makes them more alien than aliens.
Robots are ideal for players who have always felt some affinity for things mechanical.
Although robots will not suit everyone, some players will immediately find a home for their psyche inside one of these alloy-cans.
Have you ever found yourself establishing immediate rapport with your home computer, toaster or electric drill?
If so, you may find yourself at home in this chapter.

Do not enter the robotic realm without consideration.
Though it may seem appealing, there are many things to consider.
First of all, the robots are not basic humanoid form.
Few players can relate to being shaped like a cube and floating around on anti-grav.
There are many advantages and disadvantages to being a robot  
all of which take a lot of getting used to.
The robotic class can be riotous fun for those players who can relate to the completely different physical and mental construction  
and can result in severe problems for those who cannot adapt.

.There are no robot storks.

Those players who have chosen robot personas have their work cut out for them.
The robots are completely unlike either humanoids or aliens.
The system for designing robots is also unique and involves the use of a great many tables.
The process is actually quite straightforward and can be executed via the following checklist:

== Bot Attributes

Although attributes for robots are comprised of the usual seven (AWE, CHA, CON, DEX, INT, MSTR, PSTR and HPS), their generation differs.
There are four prime requisites:  CON, DEX, INT and PSTR.
Each of these is determined initially on a four-sided die and is referred to as the level of the attribute.
A player that rolls a three for PSTR thus has a PSTR level of 3.
The level of the attribute is quite distinct from the true value of the attribute.
The levels are used to determine what robotic type the player will have and must be converted to standard attribute values for play.
Although a robots attributes may change in the course of a campaign, its attribute level cannot change.
So before moving on the persona will be have four attribute levels each between one and four.
For example the robot Persona Sal has a CON level of 2, a DEX level of 2, an INT level of 3 and a PSTR level of 4.
These attribute levels are endlessly important for robot personas.

Once the attribute levels have been used to determine the robot type, they need to be converted to standard attributes.
The conversion equations for CON, DEX INT and PSTR are given on the Robotic Attribute Conversion Table.
The remaining attributes (AWE, CHA) are rolled as usual  
on 3 six sides.
Incidentally, MSTR for bots is always 0, which in fact may create ground for fascinating philosophical arguments best not pursued herein.
HPS are dependent on each Robot Type, and are calculated once the robot type is determined.

//<figure id="attachment_672" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-672" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i2.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/robotassembly.54-300x213.png?resize=300%2C213[Anthros building robots to replace anthros.,300]](https://i0.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/robotassembly.54.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-672" class="wp-caption-text">+++Anthros building robots to replace anthros.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== Robot Type

When the personas attributes and attribute levels have been determined, refer to Table 5.2: Robot Type Determination Table to see what possibilities available to the player.
For example, a bot with a PSTR Level III would look down the column for PSTR III and find that three robot types (F, H & J) are allowed.
This is repeated for each of the four attributes.
The robot type that appears most frequently becomes the personas robot type.
In the case of a tie, the player is free to choose.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Base_Anthro_Type.adoc[]

Lets consider a bot named Sal.
Her attribute levels are CON 2, DEX 2, INT 3 and PSTR 4.
The player would go down the columns of theTable 5.2: Robot Type Determination Table_ _to see which robot types apply.
For instance, her CON of 2 is indicative of robot types C, D, I, M, S and V.
This corresponds with robot types (C) Combat, (D) Data Analyzer, (I) Industrial, (M) Maintenance, (S) Social, and (V) Veterinarian.
The player must go down each of columns for each of her four attribute levels tallying the robot types as she goes along.
Continuing with Sal's DEX level of 2 (D, E, I, J, M, R, S),  INT level of 3 (C, H, M, P, R, S, V) and PSTR of 4 (A, C, I).
Referring to the table below the player may choose between 4 robot types: (C) Combat Robot, (I) Industrial, (M) Maintenance Robot, and (S) Social.

// table insert 25

The robot types are listed in the following pages.
Each type is described and its particular parameters are listed.
There are seven points that the player must record about her bot persona.
These are: ATTRIBUTE LEVELS, ATTRIBUTES, ATTACKS (Offensive Systems), DEFENCES (Defensive Systems), HIT POINTS, RANDOM (random peripherals), ADAPTABILITY, VALUE, SIZE and ATTRIBUTES (attribute requirements.

*LEVELS:* These are the attribute levels required for robot type in question as found in step (2) Determine Bot Type, on Table 5.2 Robot Type Determination Table.

*ATTRIBUTES*: The normalized attributes help define further divisions of the robotic types.
Some of the robot types have further classifications within the type.
For instance, there is more than one type of combat robot, or industrial bot, and which sub-type of robot the persona can be depends on the normalized attributes.
For example, all policing robots have an INT level of III but a special operations policing robots INT must be at least 15.
See Table 5.3 Robotic Attributes Table to convert attribute levels to regular attributes.

*ATTACKS*: determines the attacks that the robot can have.
Remember that these robots are completely insane and an offensive weapon does not necessarily mean a gun or a bomb but it could indicate a defective piece of equipment that the malfunctioning robot is using as a weapon.
Attacks are more completely described in step 10 
offensive systems, in this chapter.
A percentage value indicates the percent chance that a robot will have an offensive weapon.
The number of rolls is the number surrounded in brackets.
An analog robot would receive a 5% chance at one attack.
If there is only a number listed beside Attacks, then that is the number.
Step (10) Offensive Systems and the tables there determine the types of attacks.

*DEFENCES*: determines the combat defences that the robot can have.
Remember that these robots are completely insane and a defensive weapon does not necessarily mean a force field or special armour but it could indicate a defective piece of equipment that the malfunctioning robot is using as a defence.
Defences are more completely described in step 11 
defensive systems, in this chapter.
A percentage value indicates the percent chance that a robot will have a defensive weapon.
The number of rolls is the number surrounded in brackets.
An analog robot would receive a 24% chance at two defences.
If there is only a number listed beside DEFences, then that is the number of defences.
The type of defence is determined in the defensive system part of this chapter.
Step (11) Defensive Systems help determine the types of defences.

*HIT POINTS:* this is the amount of hit points per point of CON that the robot has.
Step (17) gives more information about robotic Hit Points (HPS)

*RANDOM*: determines how many random peripherals are attached to the robot.
The peripherals are gadgets that allow the robot to be more useful and flexible.
Normally, a robot will get just one roll in the peripheral systems (Step 12 of this chapter).
Such robots are listed as normal
other robots have a percentage chance of having extra rolls on the peripheral table.
Step (12) Peripheral Systems has all the appropriate tables for determining the type of random peripherals.

*ADAPTABILITY*: represents the adaptability of the robot.
If it is very easily attached to new robotic peripherals, then its adaptability will be high.
The percentage chance equals the likelihood that an object can be interfaced with the robot.
This same value is added to the mechanics PT roll.

*VALUE*: is the standard currency value of the most basic version of the robot type.
The more peripherals attached to the bot, the more valuable it becomes.
This represents the simple base value.

*SIZE*: indicates whether a robot is designed for outdoor use or indoor use.
Robots designed to withstand the elements and function outside of buildings are larger than those that are produced for indoor use.
The size classifications are indoor (smaller) and outdoor (larger).
If the persona wants to be a small outside robot, she may use the indoor size voluntarily;
however, robots cannot be made larger by choice.+++<figure id="attachment_9642" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9642" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[.size-medium.wp-image-9642] image::https://i2.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/cable_face_desat-300x300.jpg?resize=300%2C300[studiostoks.

modified HM,300]+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-9642" class="wp-caption-text">+++Android migraines are the worst.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++



== *3) Base Race*

This is the race that the robot was designed and manufactured for.
Unless otherwise specified, a bot will not harm or allow to come to harm any member of its base race.
So, if a robot were to have an equine base race, then the persona would not be allowed to damage any equine that she met.
Nor would the robot allow the base race to accidentally come to harm.
Every robot type, except for androids and combat robots, must obey this tenet.

Non-lethal attacks that inflict small amounts of damage can be employed against a robots base race.
A robot will protect a member of its base race from other expedition members also.
This is a major inconvenience that the player must get around when running a robot.

The more insane a robot is, the more flexible the application of this core programmed law.
The law itself is not corrupted but its application becomes contorted.
Whenever the player wants to challenge the protection of her base race, she must make a control factor roll for her robot.
More information about control factor is found later in this chapter.
The referee may ignore this restriction for any referee robot that she wishes to.

// table insert 53

== 4) Armour Rating

All bots have a base AR of 700.
It is important to note that armour rating values are the same for robots and all other personas.
A robot has no immunity from punches, slashes and bangs just because they are composed of special alloys.
A successful to hit roll will do damage to a robot as it would to any other target.
So a to hit roll of 700 or higher would damage a bot with an AR 700 just as it would damage any other persona with an AR of 700.
Robots are different from biological creatures and damage differently.
This aspect of damage is covered in this chapter under robotic damage.

== 5) Movement Rate

Robotic movement rates are determined by the robots DEX value.
Table 5.6: _Robotic Movement_ is used to determine the maximum movement rate of the robot in hexes per unit.
Robots are twice as fast as those personas with the same DEX.
Those bots which move faster than 8 h/u, must accelerate the same as vehicles.
Robotic acceleration is one hex per unit per PSTR level (I-IV).

A robot that has a 17 DEX and PSTR level of 3 would move 8 h/u at first, 11 h/u the next unit and then reach maximum speed of 14 h/u in the next unit.
These cumbersome acceleration rules should only be applied in rare instances when the players have decided that picayune detail is of upmost importance.
Depending on the locomotion type, bots are affected by terrain just as regular personas are.
More information about robotic movement is covered under locomotion in this chapter.

// table insert 54

== 6) Wate Allowance

Bots are affected by encumbrance, though not as much as other personas.
As expected, weight allowance is determined by the PSTR and the PSTR level of the bot.
The wate allowance of a robot, measured in kilograms, is determined on the _Robotic Wate Allowance_ table.
A robot with a PSTR level of 3 and a 17 PSTR would have a wate allowance of 75 kgs.
This means that the robot can carry 75 kgs before any movement penalties are incurred.
All penalties of encumbrance apply to robots as they would apply to other personas.
These affects are detailed in http://expgame.com/?page_id=279[Chapter 18: Encumbrance].

// table insert 55

== 7) Power Source

All bots operate on electrical power but the cell (or supercell) that converts the source into electrical power will vary.
For gaming simplicity, all cells work due to ingenious technological advances that require little or no explanation.
All robotic power cells are rechargeable and may even be better described as extremely efficient motors.
Each battery type functions equally well but the conditions under which they function varies and this is the most important factor of determining the battery type.

The bots cell storage capacity depends on its CON attribute.
A robot can function for one month per point of CON per fully charged battery set.
If the bots CON drops during play, then its fuel capacity decreases proportionately.
When a bot runs out of power, the machine will completely shut down until refuelled.
Unless the robot has built-in charge indicators, fuel depletion will not be apparent until the final month.
Use of peripherals does not drain the robot any more than usual;
their batteries will last the predetermined length of time regardless of the activities engaged in.

It should always be made possible for a robot to recharge its power source.
A campaign could become boring if all robot personas did was spend their time searching for fuel.
The requirements of recharging robotic power cells is different for each cell type;
however, the duration of refuelling is generally the same.
One hour must be spent refuelling for each month of charge stored.
Refuelling might mean being plugged into a wall, filtering water for a well or being manually packed with fissionable material.

// table insert 56

*1) Basic cells:* These cells contain chemicals in the specified states which are transformed miraculously and efficiently into electrical energy.
The nature of the chemicals required is optional.
The referee may elect to specify some particular required substance (e.g., natural gas, manure-for agricultural bots, hair-for barber shop bots, etc.) or she may generously allow the bot to use any material of a compatible form.
It is usually best (and more fun) if the ref specifies some substance or range of substances limited enough to require a modicum of effort but not so difficult to locate that it slows down the game.

Normally, gas and liquid cells will cease operation if exposed to a vacuum.
They will return to normal once atmosphere is returned.
How a bot fuel cell operates in a vacuum is highly dependent on the type of robot involved.
If a robot type is specifically designed to operate in a vacuum, then it is given that its power plan is protected too.
For example, an extra-planetary explorations bot could function exatmo regardless of its cell type.

Solid cells function fine in vacuums but do not function at high temperature.
Prolonged exposure to temperatures that may not damage the robot may damage its power cell.
Things such as fusion attacks, napalm blasts and burning buildings are good examples of situations that will shut off the robots power plant.
Solid cells will return to normal once they are cooled down.
Extreme heat could destroy a bots solid cell.

*2) Broadcast**:* Broadcast cells are actually power receivers that convert transmissions from a source into energy.
The receivers will cease to function if they are electronically jammed or taken out of broadcast range.
Robots using broadcast power cannot store any energy and, if they are cut off from their power source or its destroyed, they will cease to function.
Otherwise, there is no limit to the length of time that a broadcast receiver cell can power its robot.
If the referee wishes, she may enforce regular maintenance of the receiver cells.

*3) Dynamo:* Internal gyros manufacture the useable energy for this cell.
The dynamo cell is very close to being a perpetual motion machine.
In this instance &#8220;close to perpetual&#8221;
means the normal duration for a robotic battery.
Dynamo cells can be recharged by plugging into the nearest electrical outlet.
Dynamos will not function when exposed to more than 2 gravities.

*4) Gravitational:* This power cell converts gravitational force into electrical energy.
An explanation of this phenomenon will not even be attempted;
it will have to suffice that this is a black box device that is only discussed in its operational parameters.
The gravitational cell will work continuously if there is gravitational force acting on it.
The gravitational force cannot exceed 3g or be less than one half g.
The gravitational cell will store energy for those instances where the gravity is not conducive to the cells function.
During such times, the robot can function for 1 hour per point of CON.
So a bot with a 16 CON and a gravitational cell could function indefinitely in gravity and up to 16 hours in its absence.

*5) Magnetic:* The magnetic forces generated by the cells molecules are amplified and directed to produce electrical power for the robot.
Depletion indicates a disruption of the materials magnetic qualities.
Regeneration of this cell requires electrical recharge and re-magnetizes the power cells functional material.
Magnetic cells will be disrupted by any magnetic based attacks or disruptions.
Severe disruptions may cause the cell to be demagnetized and require recharging.
This is left to the discretion of the referee.

*6) Nuclear:* This type of robot battery could utilize any of the standard nuclear power sources: fusion, fission, etc.
Robots with nuclear power cells cannot voluntarily explode like an atomic or nuclear weapon.
In fact, it is virtually impossible.
The nuclear cell is so efficient that there is hardly enough material to present a radiation hazard.
The cell has the limited life span of a robot battery but it is unaffected by changes in gravity or atmosphere.
Fissionable materials are required for the replenishment of nuclear batteries.

*7) Plasmoid:* Superheated gases are contained in &#8220;magnetic&#8221;
bottles.
If the seal is broken on these bottles, then the reaction stops or is re-calibrated for smaller uncompromised bottles.
This should make it virtually impossible for Mechanics to use the plasmoid cell maliciously.
Plasmoid cells are rechargeable like any other cells.
If the atmospheric gravity should exceed 4g, then the plasmoid reaction will stop until a manageable gravity is returned.
Such high gravities can occur during high accelerations.
Reactivating depleted plasmoid batteries requires the re-introduction of inactive plasmodial materials.

*8) Psionic:* Psionic cells convert the surrounding psychic energy into electrical forces that allow the robot to function.
Provided there are sentient beings with MSTR around the robot, it will be continuously charged.
Whenever this robot depletes its power cell, it will randomly attack any creature that has MSTR in the area.
The process is carried out by the cell itself and the robot cannot choose the target.
The robot may even be unaware of how its batteries function.

Once a target is chosen, it will get a save versus psionic attack.
The batteries will have a random MSTR of d6.
The MSTR of the batteries will be re-rolled each depletion.
If the target saves, another is randomly chosen until the battery is successful.
One full battery recharge will draining 1 point of MSTR.
This could eventually kill a repeat target.
To be susceptible, the target must be within close range.

*9) Solar:* Any light source that is capable of surrounding the robot is sufficient for it to function at full capacity.
So, in order to be able to function, this robot must be immersed in any light source.
An overhead bulb would be as efficient as an orbiting sun.
As long as this robot is operating in light, its solar cell will always be fully charged.
The robots solar cell not only converts light into energy but it can also store light for operation in complete darkness.
A solar cell that has been exposed to light for a day can store 1 hours energy per point of the robots CON.
So a bot with a 16 CON and a solar cell could function indefinitely in light and up to 16 hours in complete darkness.

== 8) Sensors

All robots will have built-in audio and video sensors which will allow the robot to "`hear`" and "`see`".
Robots do not have regular sensations for touch and no capacity for smell.
The basic sensory system works with full colour, directional vision and with all around acoustic hearing.
This makes the robotic senses identical to how any other persona would see and hear.
The built in sensors are defined by the bot's AWE attribute and are not damaged unless that attribute is.
Robots will receive one additional sensor for every 4 points of AWE.
The new sensor type is rolled on the _Robotic Sensor_ table.

// table insert 57

*1) Video:* This robot has an extra set of video sensors.
These essentially act as an extra set of eyes for the robot.
These can be built into the robot's hull or conveniently attached to the end of an articulation.

*2) Alternate optical:* Alternate forms of optical vision include laser sights or ultraviolet/infrared detectors.
These types of vision can be included in the robot's regular vision or considered an extra component.
The primary function of the alternate optical sensor is that it allows the robot to easily see in darkness.

*3) Vibrations:* Vibration sensors are very specialized detectors that easily convert molecular vibrations into comprehensible robotic vision.
This sensory feature will cut through any obscuring clouds of gas or particulate debris.
The maximum range of a vibration sensor is 5 hexes per point of AWE.
Vibration sensors are directional and the robot must look towards whatever she wants to observe.

*4) Sonar:* Sonar will allow the bot to perceive a spherical image in any medium in which it immerses its sonar.
The sonar sensor's range is 10 hexes her point of AWE.
Sonar will function through any continuous substance but will be obscured by changes in density of the carrier medium.
For instance, sonar will work equally well through air, water or smoke but it will not function across the boundaries of these.
Sonar cannot function in a vacuum.

*5) Radar:* Radar sensors offer 360° vision around the robot.
This is a 360° disk and not a spherical area of detection.
This allows the robot to detect objects and determine their wate within 10 hexes per point of AWE.
The radar will see through any medium that is not solid.

*6) Refs Own Table:* Create your own.
Organic eyes, tentacles, olfactory unit.

== 9) Locomotion

This means of locomotion, in addition to being an important necessity, will add a great deal of personality and individuality to the bot.
The locomotion type is the first indication of the appearance of the robot and it will greatly affect the development of the persona.
To determine the robot's locomotion type, roll once on Table 5.9: _Robotic Locomotion_.

The locomotion type occasionally needs to be supplemented by a roll on the _Robotic Locomotion Sub-table_.
When a locomotion type requires such a roll, it indicates that the basic form of locomotion requires some assistance in working.
For example, if the locomotion type is sails, another roll is made on the sub-table to determine what the bot will sail along on (wheels, skis, chemical slide or antigrav).
Regardless of the locomotion type rolled, all will function essentially equally.

A robot that bounces on 3 pods will function as well as one with 9 pods, which will function as well as one that has wheels.
The main difference between the locomotion types is that some will allow the robot to fly, while others will keep it bound to the ground.
Regardless of the apparent nature of any of these modes of locomotion, bots will always travel at their predetermined movement rate.

// table insert 58

// table insert 59

*1) Antigrav:* This enviable transportation mode allows the bot to fly and flit about with the greatest of east to an undetermined maximum height.
Antigrav is a classic science fiction term for anti-gravity.
This robot can travel about as though gravity has no effect upon it.
The robot has no obvious external mechanisms that assist its buoyancy in the sky.
As ideal as antigrav is, it will only function within a gravity well.
If antigrav has appeared as  Secondary Locomotion Type, then the bot is considered to be buoyant but some other form of locomotion gives the robot direction.

*2) Chemical slide:* All the bot does is angle its base, ooze some slippery goo underneath and along it slides.
This process leaves a quickly evaporating trail behind it similar to a slug's.
This comparison does not necessarily imply the bot will be slow.
A chemical slide will operate just as well up a slope as down a slope.
Sand, stairs and other difficult terrain may prove to be a challenge for a robot with this locomotive type.
How difficult such travel is depends entirely on the referee.
When a chemical slide is from the Secondary Locomotion Table it is offering a frictionless surface on which the primary locomotive type (sails, propellers or jets) is producing the power and direction.

*3) Electromagnetic legs:* Electromagnetic legs are visible beams of force which support the robot at a constant height above the ground.
There are 1 to 4 electromagnetic legs.
Electromagnetic legs adjust for terrain by altering their height and generated force.
This form of locomotion keeps the robot level for all but the most unstable terrain.
Electromagnetic legs will not allow the robot to walk on water nor will they allow the robot to cross deep chasms.
The legs generate force on the surface which supports the robot and cannot extend the robot more than 1 metre (half a hex) off of the ground.

*4) Jets:* Robotic jets are intake-less and do not eject dangerous super-heated propellants.
There are 2 to 5 jets (d4 plus 1).
The jets offer substantial thrust to push the robot around and offer direction.
Jets work whether the robot is inatmo or exatmo.
Jets are often attached to robots that have wheels, skis or chemical slides.
Regardless of what the robot slides along on, all jets will function equivalently.
Combining jets with antigrav will allow the robot to manoeuvre in the air.

*5) Magnetics:* A magnetic locomotion unit allows the robot to hover above the ground and effortlessly float along.
The height of the robot is fixed at no higher than 1 hex.
This locomotion type resembles antigrav in most regards except that magnetic will only work above a solid surface.
Robots on magnetic locomotion will often float around long after their locomotion has been destroyed.

*6) Pistons:* High-speed pistons alternately poking up and down keep the bot aloft.
There are 1 to 10 pistons.
A single piston will cause the robot to appear to be riding a single pogo stick.
The timing of the pistons is so immaculately integrated that a robot that moves long on bouncing pistons will remain as steady as a robot on any other locomotive type.

*7) Pods:* Pods are the mechanical legs that are expected to be found on robots.
There are 4 to16 pods.
Bots that have these articulated poles will either hop, scuttle or patter from one place to another.

*8) Propellers:* Robotic propellers are quiet, high-powered and safely encased air screws that can direct the robot to give it acceleration in its chosen direction.
There are 1 to 6 propellers.
Depending on the Locomotion Sub-table roll, the propellers may push the robot about on a set of wheels, along a chemical slide or through the air on antigrav.

*9) Sails:* Sails are very sturdy, molecular chain planes.
The robot alters the sails electromagnetically to allow only those air molecules which are travelling parallel to the desired direction to strike the sail.
There are 1 to 3 sails.
Between these very selective filtering and computerized tacking procedures, the robot can achieve speeds that are equivalent to any other locomotive type.
The sails may be used to drive the robot along on its wheels or through the air on its antigrav, depending on the _Locomotion Sub-table_ roll.
The durability of the sales makes them almost impossible to tear and they can only be damaged in combat if the robot's locomotion is damaged.

*10) Skis:* The robot's skis are attached to articulated pods that can drive them over almost any type of terrain.
There are 3 to 6 (d4 plus 2) skis.
The skis operate like cross-country skis because they can travel up a slope as easily as down a slope.
There is no difference in speed whether the robot is trotting uphill or sliding down slopes.
When skis are a Secondary Locomotion Type, they are attached to articulated pods and not powered legs.
The skis would be the surface contact but jets, sails or propellers would drive them.

*11) Slog bag:* A slog bag appears as a flexible, fluid filled sack that is attached to the undercarriage of the robot.
The robot maintains an even balance while the slog bag undulates and contorts itself along the surface it is travelling.
The slog bag moves like a sack of mercury might, although there is no reason that it has to contain a liquid.
The slog bag cannot be punctured during regular combat unless the robot's locomotion is damaged.

*12) Tracks:* Robotic tracks are nothing more than rubber-coated tank tracks.
There are 1 to 6 tracks.
This form of locomotion is rugged, although not especially graceful.
A single tracked robot can change direction by altering the tension on one side of the track versus the tension of the other side.

*13) Wheels:* Robotic wheels are singularly powered, axle-less and have solid tires.
A robot could have any number of wheels and it could even be a unicycle.
There are 1 to 12 wheels.
Robots the have wheels as a secondary locomotion type they non-powered wheels.
The Primary Locomotion Type (sails, jets, propellers etc.) generate the force.

== 10) Offensive Systems

Robotic attacks are rarely built-in devices designed for inflicting damage on targets in combat.
The robots in EXP have a particularly high level of free will and hence are considered quite insane.
The majority of weapons that robots will use are mismanaged devices that are intended for some other purpose.
An industrial robot may have two attacks but neither of them would be a gun or a grenade launcher, although the attacking device may function exactly like one.
The construction robot may fire nails from its nail gun and that may function just like a low-powered pistol or it may have a malfunctioning welder that is acting just like a flame thrower.
Only robots such as combat robots would actually have a military gun as a peripheral but this doesn't mean that malfunctioning robotic peripherals are any less dangerous.

*All Robots Can Ram:* A robot's most basic attack is ramming.
Any robot can self-destructively fling itself into a target hoping to inflict damage on it.
To inflict damage while ramming, the robot must make a successful to hit roll.
The amount of damage inflicted on the target is dependent on the wate and speed of the robot.
The wate of the target is also considered.
Many robots will have no attacks at all and this indicates that they can only ram targets and that is only done with difficulty.
Robots that have not rolled ramming as an attack must make a successful control factor roll before they will be able to ram into the target.
Those robots that have ramming as an attack can ram anything that they wish.
http://expgame.com/?page_id=306[Chapter 31: Robotic Combat] discusses this topic in greater detail.
In this chapter, the player is determining what attacks her persona has and not the exact mechanisms of how they are played.

*Determining Attacks:* The number of attacks that a robot persona can have depends on the attack listing (ATTACKS) under the robotic type.
Those robotic types that are listed with "`Nil`" get no attack other than intermittent ramming.
Other robot types have a percentage chance of having a roll on one of the attack tables.
If the percentage roll is successful, then the player will get the number of rolls listed on _Attack Table One_.
Sometimes a particular attack table is indicated as with combat robots.

The attack tables increase in number as the deadlines of the attacks increase.
Higher attack tables can give the robot multiple attacks from lower attack tables and lower attack tables can sneak onto higher ones.
A robot with multiple attacks can use each attack every unit of combat.
Explanations of the various attack types are discussed in paragraphs following the attack tables.

// table insert 60

*1) Deadly Random Ability:* This is the most difficult attack type for the referee to run.
She and the player must decide what peripheral the robot can use as an attack.
If time is of the essence or if the player is being particularly difficult in the arbitration, then the referee can ignore this roll and have the player roll again.

This attack type is difficult because there are no guidelines for damage, range, area of effect or range of the attack.
All of these parameters must be decided before the random ability is allowed to be used as a weapon.
Some examples of deadly peripherals are given as follows: An air conditioning unit that can attack like a cryo frag grenade but can also be used to maintain a comfortable atmosphere;
a photocopier that can be used to copy leaflets or flash at targets and blind them (saving throw granted).

*2) Type A Weapon:* These are malfunctioning peripherals that can be used as weapons by the robot.
The weapon type indicates what the malfunctioning attacks like but not what it is.
Arrows, daggers and bolts could be mail guns or staplers.
A shuriken could be tin can lids.
A staff could be a rolling pin.
A flag poke could attack as a lance.
A rake could attack as a pike.
A nail hammer could be used as a head hammer.

The weapon types are explained in http://expgame.com/?page_id=298[Chapter 27: Tactical Combat].
The main difference is that type A weapons are thrusting and striking weapons, adding the PSTR as a damage adjustment and type B weapons are ranged attacks that only add to half PSTR as a damage adjustment.
The weapon types cannot be criss-crossed.
A type A spear could only be used as a type A spear and not as a type B throwing spear also.
For convenience, the weapon damages are included on the _Robotic Weapon Type_ table.
How these weapons work, ranges, etc.
are covered in section II, Combat Rules.

// table insert 61

*3) Ramming:* Not all bots are able to nonchalantly crash into objects.
Before any robot can willingly risk damaging itself and its target, it must make a control factor roll.
Robots that have ramming as an attack do not have to make a control factor roll before they ram.
A robot will only be able to ram opponents with a pre-determined section of its chassis.
This part will be considered the least vital and most able to withstand the repeated punishment.
The ramming part of the robot's chassis is determined by rolling on the Table 5.13: _Robotic Ramming_.
Players must keep Newton's law in mind and remember that bots do not just dole out damage when they ram but they can be damaged themselves, depending on the wate of the target.

// table insert 62

// table insert 63

*1) Type B Weapons:* These are malfunctioning peripheral equivalent of ranged weapons and that indicates something that is ejected from the robot or something that is thrown by the robot.
Each robot will start with 1 to 1000 charges of things such as bolts, arrows or bullets.
Those type B weapons that are marked by an asterisk (*) are limited to 1-8 of that retrievable weapon.
For example: a robot with 4 axes could throw 4 of them and then would have to go retrieve them before it could throw any more.

// table insert 64

*2) Poisons:* Poisons are toxic substances that can have an immediate effect on organic creatures that are exposed to them.
The robot may spray lubricants from a fractured joint or squirt super cell by-products onto targets.
Some of the poisons may actually just be conductors that allow the robot to transmit radiations or electricity.
Poisons are sprayed onto targets and the range of the attack is 1 hex per 2 points of PSTR.
The target persona gets a saving throw versus poison and the poison toxicity (intensity) is randomly generated each time (3d4 intensity).
If the target saves, the poison has no effect.
If the persona fails her saving throw, she will be incapacitated by the poison in 0 to 3 units (d4-1).

*3) Weapons:* There are 4 different kinds of weapons that appear on Table 5.14 Robotic Attack Table Two.
They are: energy, inertia, stun and vibro.
On this table they are primarily  thrusting and striking weapons.
Check the type onTable 5.12 Type A Weapon Type.
Details for these weapons are found in http://expgame.com/?page_id=345[Chapter 49: _Miscellaneous Weapons_].
Refer to that chapter to get the details of these weapon types.
The weapon type that the miscellaneous weapon models its damage after is rolled on the _Robotic Weapons Type_ table.

// table insert 65

*1) Poisons:* Poisons are toxic substances that can have an immediate effect on organic creatures that are exposed to them.
The robot may spray lubricants from a fractured joint or squirt super cell by-products onto targets.
Some of the poisons may actually just be conductors that allow the robot to transmit radiations or electricity.
Poisons are sprayed onto targets and the range of the attack is 1 hex per 2 points of PSTR.
The target persona gets a saving throw versus poison and the poison toxicity (intensity) is randomly generated each time (5d4 intensity).
If the target saves, the poison has no effect.
If the persona fails her saving throw, she will be incapacitated by the poison in 0 to 3 units (d4-1).

*2) Weapons:* There are 4 different kinds of weapons that appear on Table 5.16 Robotic Attack Table Three.
They are: energy, inertia, stun and vibro.
On This attack table they are primarily ranged weapons.
See Table 5.15 Type B Weapon Type.
More details are available in http://expgame.com/?page_id=345[Chapter 49: _Miscellaneous Weapons_].
Refer to that chapter to get the details of these weapon types.
The weapon type that the miscellaneous weapon models its damage after is rolled on the _Robotic Weapons Type_ table.

*3) Blasts/Mists:* The blast or mist shoots forth from the robot with a range of 1 hex per point of DEX.
It attacks as a Type B ranged non-powered weapon.
A successful hit will do damage.
The Cold/Heat Blast inflicts 1d6 of damage per point of PSTR.
The Acid/Base Mist delivers 1d8 of damage per point of PSTR

* 4) Gun:* Refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=339[Chapter 46 Guns].
Keep rolling on the gun table until a medium powered weapon or less is generated.
This means that no weapons that do not have a caliber, or energy level can be rolled.
Yes that is frustrating.
Robots do not express frustration.

*5) Aerosols:* Refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=337[Chapter 45 Grenades and Aerosols].
The player can only roll for an Aerosol.
If a non-combat aerosol is rolled the player may roll again, keeping the non-combat aerosol as well.

// table insert 66

*1) Poison:* Poisons are toxic substances that can have an immediate effect on organic creatures that are exposed to them.
The robot may spray lubricants from a fractured joint or squirt super cell by-products onto targets.
Some of the poisons may actually just be conductors that allow the robot to transmit radiations or electricity.
Poisons are sprayed onto targets and the range of the attack is 1 hex per 2 points of PSTR.
The target persona gets a saving throw versus poison and the poison toxicity (intensity) is randomly generated each time (4d4 intensity).
If the target saves, the killing poison will do 1d4 in damage per 2 points of intensity.
If the persona fails her saving throw, she will drop to -1 Hit Point and die soon after.

*2) Gun:* Refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=339[Chapter 46 Guns].
Any gun type that is rolled on the table there is built into this robot.

*3) Grenade/Aerosol:* Refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=337[Chapter 45 Grenades and Aerosols].
The player can make one roll on the table.
If a non-combat grenade or aerosol is rolled the player may roll again, keeping the non-combat aerosol as well.

*4) Bomb:* Refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=335[Chapter 44 Bombs].
The player can make one roll on the table.
If the player rolls a bomb it is detachable and remotely detonatable by the robot.

*5) Jet:* The blast or mist shoots forth from the robot with a range of 1 hex per point of DEX.
It attacks as a Type C ranged powered weapon.
A successful hit will do damage.
The Acid/Base Jet delivers 1d12 of damage per point of CON.

*6) Attack Mutation:*** **The player can roll one combat/attack mutation gleaned from Section IV Mutations.
The robot will have a physical mutation if the player rolls deci-dice (d100) less than her CON.
Otherwise the robot will have a mental mutation effect.
When a robots attack requires MSTR the robot will use her INT instead.
The mutation must be an attack mutation.
However if some other strange mutation comes along and the player can make it fit into the story of her robot, so be it!

*7) Disregard Base Race:* This does not count as a roll on Robotic Attack table Four.
However it does allow the robot to attack her base race without having to make a control factor check.

== 11) Defensive Systems

Robot defences are typically malfunctioning peripherals used as a defence in combat, or some kind of industrial hardening to protect the robot to do its prescribed task.
Occasionally robots defences are just that, a defence built to protect a robot from abuse.
Regardless of how the defences story is told the function of the defence is described here.
Each defence that the robot has listed under its robotic type earns the player one roll on Table 5.18: Robotic Defences.
For example an Interventional Medical Robot has a 10% chance of getting 1 roll on the table.
An Emergency Rescue robot has 3 rolls on the table automatically.

// table insert 67

*1) Anti-Missile*: This robot has an anti-missile system that is built into its hull.
This protective device will avoid damage from powered missile attacks likes guided bombs, missiles, grenades, rockets or directed aerosols.
The bots armour rating increases by 50 to 300 (50d6 or 1d6 times 50).
A failed to hit roll against this bot means that the missile is destroyed in its entirety and there is not area of effect or burst effect.
If a hit is scored only an area of effect can damage the bot.

*2) Anti-Personnel*: The anti-personnel device is designed to remove clamouring parasites or other organic creatures trying to grapple with the robot.
The mechanism of the anti-personnel device is chosen by the player.
Regardless of how it is described (electric shock, sonic attack, flames, shrapnel,  cotton candy webs) the effect is the same.
3d6 of damage is inflicted to all targets within the hex adjacent to the robot.
The damage is automatic.
Each target must make a saving throw versus pain (intensity equal to the damage delivered) or drop back from the robot.
This would allow the bot to move freely avoiding a swarm.

*3) Armour Rating Increase*: This indicates an increase in the base amour rating of the robot by 50 to 300 (d6 times 50).
The base AR of all robots is 700.
If one were to roll an AR increase of 250 then the base AR for this robot would be 950.
Repeat rolls on this defence will increase the robots AR each time.

*4) Artifact Armour*: The robot's regular body is replaced by a special armour type generated in http://expgame.com/?page_id=331[Chapter 42: _Armour_].
The base armour rating of the robot cannot fall below 700, and any special properties of the armour will be included in the bot's defence.
So the robot could be covered in relfec, ballistic, a force field or even powered armour.
Items that do no work, like helmets and shields should be re-rolled.

*5) Camouflage*: Often the best defence is being able to hide.
The exterior coat of this robot can blend in with the surroundings making it very hard to detect with the naked eye.
Any type of sensor that the robot has will allow it to camouflage against it.
So a robot with radar and video sensors could camouflage against radar and video.
This would make it essentially invisible to those types of vision.
Detecting this bot can only be done while actively searching and even then the searcher must make an AWE roll on a d100.

*6) Detect ambush*: Ambush detection allows the robot to quadruple its AWE when attempting to search out mines and other types of non-sentient ambushes.
A robot with a 12 AWE would have a 48 AWE searching for mines, trip wires or pressure pads.

*7) Diffuse Bombs*: This robot is a demolitions demolishing expert.
It can disassemble bombs and grenades as a 5th level mechanic and the bot can add twice its INT to the roll.
This defence can in no way assist the robot in planting bombs or making bombs.

*8) Evasive action*: Allows the robot to avoid combat situations entirely, providing it is not engaging combat itself.
This is essentially a computerized tactical withdrawal mode.
It allows the robot to move at normal through mine fields, tank traps, phalanx of soldiers and other such detriments to escape.
Each time the robot encounters an escape obstacle, it can avoid it with a d20 DEX roll.
No robot can attack while employing this defence (unless it is a combat robot).

*9) Force Field*: A robot's force field will absorb any HPS in damage that should be taken by the robot.
Once the field has absorbed its maximum damage, it will remain inactive for 1 minute per HPS absorbed.
A force field will be able to absorb 25 to 100 HPS in damage (d4 times 25).
Multiple force fields are added together and function as a single device.

*10) Increase HPS*: Increasing a robot's HPS increases the HPS total that it starts the campaign with.
A robot's HPS are increased by 10% to 60% (d6 times 10%).
A robot with 100 HPS and a HPS increase of 30% would have 130 HPS.

*11) Mental mutation*: This robot has a peripheral that has the same effect as a mental mutation.
The type of mental mutation is rolled in http://expgame.com/?page_id=364[Chapter 58: _Mental Mutations_] and it must be a defence mutation.
If the mutation is a defect, offensive or useless to the robot, then re-roll.

*12) Override interrupt**:* The bot cannot be subject to robotic override.
This means that any device designed to control robots or make them subservient will not function on this robot.

== 12) Peripheral Systems

Peripherals are attachments that give the robot some additional flexibility in performing its tasks.
These peripherals are non-combative and are used by the robot to survive day to day campaign trials.

The RANDOM listing under the robot type determines how many rolls the robot gets on the Table 5.19: _Robotic Peripherals_.
A listing of "`Normal`" indicates that the player can make one roll on the _Primary_ table.
If there is a single number listed under the RANDOM listing, then the player will make that many rolls on the Primary table.
If there is a percentage value listed, that is the chance that there is an additional roll.
If the robot type has Nil listed under RANDOM, then it has no random peripherals to start with.

The Table 5.19: Primary Robotic Peripherals is a list of harmless peripherals that are attached to the robot.
These peripherals cannot be used in combat and will not harm or damage anything in any way.
The robotic peripherals listed on the _Primary Peripheral_ table are ones which have a very limited effect on their environment.
Aroma producing could not be used to make a nausea attack, but it could help sell a house.
An articulation could not strangle an opponent but it could open a door.
There are no explanations of the particulars of the robotic peripherals other than the guidelines above.
The onus is placed on the player and the referee that the self-explanatory peripherals will not be abused.
Primary robotic peripherals will be a common reason to select Sphincter Dice from http://expgame.com/?page_id=275[Chapter 16: Special Rolls].+++<figure id="attachment_9608" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9608" style="width: 212px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[.size-medium.wp-image-9608] image::https://i0.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/lamps-albatross-212x300.png?resize=212%2C300[,212]+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-9608" class="wp-caption-text">+++Impress the natives with a light show.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

// table insert 68

Table 5:20: _Secondary Peripherals_ is quite different from Primary Peripherals.
These are peripherals and abilities that might not be explainable by standard programming hardware.
These robotic abilities are often the result of the synergistic effect of several damaged systems.
If a robot has some ability listed on the _Secondary_ table that is no indication that the particular robot type has that peripheral.
A relations bot may be amphibious but it does not mean that all relations bots are amphibious.
The robotic peripherals found on the _Secondary_ table are very briefly explained in single line sentences listed with each peripheral.
For the most part, these abilities are self-explanatory.

// table insert 69

== 13) Description

The shape of a robot is only randomly determined if the referee and player have no preconceived notion of how the robot should appear.
The robotic shape has no bearing on any other robotic abilities be they attacks, peripherals or defences.
The robot can be shaped like anything the player wants: fire hydrant, filing cabinet, kitchen appliance, etc.
If you choose to let the dice decide roll on the following two tables below to get a basic robot shape.
For example a flattened cone, but colour, design, sound, decals, smell, chrome detailing is all left to the referee and the persona.

// table insert 70

// table insert 71

== 14) Wate

A robot's wate will be determined by one of two factors: outdoor and indoor.
For robots that are designed to carry out hard work such as heavy lifting or construction, there is the outdoor wate equation.
Other robots that are not designed for such load bearing tasks use the indoor wate equation.
Regardless of the wate equation used, robots can function equally well both indoors and outdoors and only their wates will vary.

Further variation in robot wate can be attained from rolling the robot's tech level.
Tech level can be determined for any artifact in http://expgame.com/?page_id=359[Chapter 56: Tech level].
If the wate of a persona is ruining a perfectly good persona, then the value can be altered.
A robot can become lighter but NEVER heavier.
If a player wants her persona to look heavier, that is fine but the wate cannot be increased.

// table insert 72

== 15) Size

Size gives a rough estimation of the volume occupied by the robot.
It is fine to keep things simple and just make one roll to give a hite similar to other personas.
The size roll will be used to determine what the bot can reach, fit into or be covered by.
Regardless of the shape rolled step 13 Description, the bot should  fit into the volume rolled here.
For example, a sphere with the parameters 1 meter by 15 cm could become a cigar.
Extrapolations for other shapes are usually just as simple.
If the dimensions rolled are very close, they may be rounded off to make a perfect shape.

Each player rolls dimensions three times: once for each of hite, width and length.
These can be arranged in whatever order works best for the personal.
If this table is ruining a finely formed persona then ignore it, but indication of the size of the robot is helpful.

// table insert 73

== 16) Control Factor

CF is essentially a measure of the personas free will  
the higher the Control Factor, the more control the player has over her robotic persona.
If the CF is quite high, the bots personality is greatly affected.
The higher the bots INT, the higher the CF and the higher the CF, the better  
at least for the player.

*CONTROL FACTOR* (CF) = *INT* plus (*INT level* times *EXPS LEVEL*)

So a robot with an INT of 15 and INT LEVEL of 3 and was 3rd level would have a control factor (CF) of 24.

Robots were originally developed to do slave labour for the base race that they were designed for.
The robot personas controlled by the players are insane robots who don't care much for being slaves.
The more insane the bot is, the more it is like a normal player (generally not a very rational lot).
This insanity is relative.
These free willed robots are considered insane because they will look after their own self interest before they'll do their robotic duties.
An insane robot does not mean that the player must run her robot personal like a lunatic but that she can control her personal however she wishes.

The insanity level of the bot, or the amount of free will it has, is measured by its Control Factor.
The robot's Control Factor (CF) is the resistance it has to reverting to a normal functioning robot.
Whenever the robot is functioning as a normal bot, the persona has lost control of her persona.
When a janitorial bot starts cleaning up a room, it is functioning according to its internal programming and not the player's initiative.

*Control Factor Checks:* Control factor checks can be made whenever the robot performs a task for which it was originally designed.
For example, if a janitorial bot were to clean up a room or a combat bot were to kill something, a CF check may be in order.
If the CF check is failed, the bot will temporarily revert to being the automaton it was intended to be.
Players running robots should not be always rolling the dice to see if they lose control of their character or not.
The referee should only make her roll a CF check once in a while, perhaps when it is particularly crucial for the player to be in control of her persona.

Control factor checks are very similar to an adjusted attribute roll (see Chapter 16: _Special Rolls_).
The robot's CF is determined by the Control factor equation given above.
For instance: a 3rd level robot with a 14 INT would have a control factor of 17.
If the robot's INT drops due to damage, its CF will increase the amount of INT lost.
The more damaged, the more insane, the more free willed.

The player must roll under her control factor to maintain control of her robot persona.
Most control factor checks are made on a d20 and that is the smallest die that can be used.
More difficult CF checks may be made on d30s, d50s or deci-die.
If the robot with the CF of 17 were to voluntarily clean up a messy room (assuming it were a janitorial bot), the referee may require a d20 CF check.
If the robot were ordered to clean up a room by a charismatic member of its base race and if the persona giving the order was a Mechanic with robotic skill, the robot may have to make a d50 CF check.

*Loss of Control:* A failed CF check will indicate that the player has temporarily lost control of her persona.
This loss of control could be critical to the robot's survival and CF checks can often be life or death rolls.
The duration of the CF failure depends on the type of CF failure that occurred.
If the failure occurs during combat then it will last a random number of units determined by the die that tested the robot's CF.
So a robot failing a d50 CF check would become a referee persona robot for d50 units.
If the CF check occurs during non-combat then the personal will revert to being a robot for a random number of minutes determined by the die that tested the robot's CF.
So a robot failing a d50 CF check would become a referee persona robot for d50 minutes.

== 17) Hit Points (HPS)

Hit points for robots work the same way they do for other personas.
The major difference is that bots do not go unconscious when they reach zero hit points, nor do they die, nor can they be knocked unconscious nor can they heal their damage.
A hit point is a hit point regardless of whether it's a robot's or an alien's or an anthropomorph's.
The difference lies in how losing HPS affects the bot.
Old robots never die -- they just wear out.
This topic is covered under Robotic Damage in this chapter.

Each bot gets one HPS factor per point of CON.
An exploration bot (F) with a 20 CON would have 300 HPS and an analog bot (A) with a 4 CON could have between 12 and 16 HPS.

== 18) Tech Level

The player should roll a http://expgame.com/?page_id=359[Chapter 56 Tech Level] for her robot persona.
This roll can adjust the wate and value of the robot.
A strange tech level could possibly make it more difficult to adapt a robot.
The tech level roll can make a robot lighter but it cannot make it any heavier.
If no tech level is rolled, the robot is assumed to have a tech level of 10.

== 19) Adaptability

Only Mechanics can fit peripheral devices onto bots and this is done using the _Mechanics`' Performance Tables_.
The ADAPTABILITY is the percentage added to the Mechanic's PT roll, thus increasing the mechanic's chance for success.
The Degree of Difficulty of the particular procedure is determined by the ref.
Those bots with no adaptability percentage are designed to not be tampered with and instead of a PT roll bonus, the Mechanic suffers a 3 DD penalty.

== 20) Robot Value

The value of the bot is its base worth relative to all the robot types described.
The values indicated are for the basic unit that rolls off the assembly line.
The strange peripherals that may have just happened, or are added to the basic robot type, increase the robot's value.
Primary peripherals are worth about 10000 to 60000 each and secondary peripherals about 100000 to 600000 each.
The adjustment of the robot's base value is really up to the referee.
Any artifacts that are attached to the robot are tripled in value and added to the robot's value.
Robots that are worth incredible sums of money or have particularly valuable peripherals will often find themselves being greedily pursued by former owners or prospective "`buyers`".

== Robot Experience

As a bot gains more experience, it begins to solidify and reinforce its individuality and personality.
The robot becomes more insane as it gathers data moderated by its own free will.
The more individualistic and independent it becomes, the more insane it is.
Remember that insanity in a robot does not mean lunacy, just robotic free will.
Robots will gain experience by engaging in combat, taking damage and taking more damage.

5% of combat EXP's can be converted into data that will reinforce the robot's independent thought.
Nothing will increase the robot's free will more than damage.
Robots will earn 20 EXP's per HPS of damage they take.
Increasing a robot's level will increase its control factor and hence its free will.

Bots cannot acquire experience points for performing functions for which they were designed.
A domestic bot will not get experience for cleaning a room but will be rewarded if lucky enough to expose an informative fresco in the process of doing so.
A bot with painting skill would not be rewarded for painting a house but would gain experience points for using that same ability to spray paint into the eyes of the opponent.
So, novel use of a built-in skill will be rewarded with experience points.

// table insert 76

== Robotic Damage

Many of the robot types seem to have enormous HPS totals.
This is because they need them.
Many attacks such as electrical and disintegrations do double damage and robots cannot repair HPS like other personas.
When a robot is hit, any damage it takes is subtracted from its HPS total.
Damage to a robot is the same as damage to any other persona.
A punch does no less damage to a robot than it does to any other biological life form.
The HPS still represents a universal value.
This means that a robot will quickly lost HPS and will be unable to heal itself.

The major difference between other personas and robot personas is that robots do not expire upon reaching zero HPS.
When a robot's hit point total drops below zero HPS, it is damaged and not dead.
Some random part of the bot has been eroded by some degree.
This erosion is represented by a drop in the persona's attributes, including the HPS total.

Regardless of the fashion in which the robot was damaged, the injured sub-system will be randomly determined.
This could roughly be considered the same as a hit location.
An attacker could damage a bot's sensors or power plan without even aiming for that specific part.
Each time the robot is reduced to zero HPS, another part is damaged.
Robotic death, the fatal malfunction, occurs whenever any of a robot's attributes is reduced to zero or its HPS max is reduced to zero.

*Losing Hit Points:* When a robot's HPS total does drop below zero, the robot has malfunctioned.
Damaging a robot reduces its HPS max by ten percent and randomly reduces another attribute.
The bot is then returned to full HPS max, less the ten percent.
For example: a bot with a total 110 HPS drops below zero;
the bot returns to the new HPS maximum -- which is less 10% of the previous one -- in this case, 99 hit points.
This new hit point total is now the bot's HPS maximum.
If this robot were to accumulate more than 99 HPS in damage, it would be damaged again and its new HPS max would be 89.
This process of diminishing returns is undergone each time the bot reaches zero HPS total.
So the robot's HPS max would continue to decline 80, 72, 57 etc.
until it reaches zero HPS max, at which point it is destroyed.

The easiest way to calculate this is to multiply the robot's present HPS max by 0.90 and round the result DOWN.
Always round the result down.

*Losing Attributes:* Robots may now seem indestructible.
They are tough compared to organic personas but they are far from indestructible.
Usually, long before the robot's HPS max reaches 0, the bot will suffer a fatal malfunction.

It is important to note that bots cannot heal any damage that they take and they slowly or quickly fall apart and break down until their sentience is no longer supported by their machinery.
In addition to losing 10% of their HPS max, the bot also has some specific system malfunction.
Depending on which system malfunctions, some of the robot's attributes will be reduced.
Whenever any of these attributes is reduced to zero, the robot is irrevocably destroyed.

The robotic part damaged is determined on Table 5.27 Robotic System Malfunction.
Every time the robot is reduced to zero hit points a roll is made on Table 5.27 as well as on Table 5.28 Robotic Malfunction Severity.

// table insert 77

// table insert 78

== Robot Decay Tables

The damaging continues until one of the personas attributes reaches zero and the bot dies.
How on earth does one keep track of this during combat without having everything grind to a halt.
The answer is to pre-roll the effects and create a robot decay table.
Consider the following Table 5.29 Robot Decay Table for Sal the Diagnostic Veterinarian Robot.
TTL keeps track of the total damage delivered over time.
Sal decays until her AWE reaches zero and dies.

// table insert 79
