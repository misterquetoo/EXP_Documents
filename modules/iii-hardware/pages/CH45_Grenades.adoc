= Grenades

This is the chapter devoted to the classic area of effect weapon, the grenade.
Grenades generally act the same instant that they are detonated.
Only under certain circumstances may a grenade explode later than one unit after being thrown.

A grenade is any hand, claw, or paw thrown area of effect weapon.
Grenades are remarkable for their ease of use, and even more remarkable for their deadliness.
The grenade is particularly unintelligent, and will damage expedition members as indiscriminately as opponents.
No normal armour type can stop the damage of a grenade, and anything caught within the area of effect will be damaged.
There is only slim chance that a target will be able to avoid damage, and that is when the grenade is a dud.
There is only a 1 in 1000 chance that a grenade will be a dud.
Once a grenade is discharged (exploded), it is irretrievably lost.

== Grenade Type 

include::ROOT:partial$CH45_Table_Grenades.adoc[]

== Grenade Types

=== Big Bertha Grenade 

[horizontal]
Range:: PSTR
Area of Effect:: 8h
Damage:: 12-144 (12d12)
Wate:: 2kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 1000

The big bertha is a massive concussion grenade.
Aside from doing massive damage it is designed to topple targets.

.*Big Bertha Effect*
* 8h range 12d12 damage
* 12h range stun
* 16h range topple

These effects are cumulative.
A target within 8h would take damage, get stunned and get toppled.
To avoid being stunned the player must make a successful Damage System Shock roll (DSS).
To avoid being toppled the player must make a successful dexterity attribute roll ()

For those interested in the terran history of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bertha_(howitzer)[Big Bertha^].

=== Chemical Explosive Grenade 

[horizontal]
Range:: PSTR
Area of Effect:: 4h
Damage:: 8-64 (8d8)
Wate:: 0.75kg
EXPS:: 100
Value:: 200

A chemical explosive grenade is more powerful version of the typical fragmentation grenade.
The chemical explosive is the big sister of the Fragmentation grenade, and the little sister of the Big Bertha.

=== Corrosive Grenade 

[horizontal]
Range:: PSTR
Area of Effect:: 3h
Damage:: 5-40 (5d8)
Wate:: 1kg
EXPS:: 200
Value:: 300

The corrosive grenade bathes the area of effect with acids, alkalis, or a non-neutralizing combinations of both.
The corrosive grenade's contents are highly volatile, but neutralize themselves on organic surfaces.
This makes the weapon selectively more destructive to inorganic materials and personas.

After the initial explosion the residue will continue to eat away at inorganic materials.
Organic personas are damaged by the initial explosion, but not the ongoing corrosion.
Metals, plastic, rubber, etc. continue to take damage until washed clean.
Items such as armour, weapons, or robots will take an additional 2-20 hit points of damage for each of the continuing 1-8 units of reaction.
E.g., an unwashed robot could take an additional 2-20 HPS for 4 units after the initial blast.
Corrosive grenades are also known as acid baths, and Drainoh bombs.

=== Cryoblast Grenade 

[horizontal]
Range:: PSTR
Area of Effect:: 8h
Damage:: 3-30 (3d10)
Wate:: 1kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 500

The cryoblast grenade subjects everything in its area of effect to a blast of freezing cold.
The grenade is not only capable of freezing things solid, but it can trap targets in the ice that it produces.
Medium, or smaller, sized targets have a % chance, equal to the damage inflicted, of being trapped in the ice.
So a medium sized beasty that took 19 points of damage would have a 19% chance of being frozen immobile.
The cryoblast grenade can also freeze swords in scabbards, render buttons frozen, jam weapons, etc.
The cryoblast is also known as a cryofrag, a berg bomb, or a rinkmaker.

=== Energy Drain Grenade 

[horizontal]
Range:: PSTR
Area of Effect:: Special
Damage:: Special
Wate:: 0.5kg
EXPS:: 275
Value:: 3000

An energy drain grenade will suck the life out of nearby potential energy stores (batteries), and then self destruct.
Any batteries within a 10 hex radius will be instantly devoid of charge.
The grenade will then shower a smaller 3 hex area of effect with its fragments, and kinetic energy.
This explosion will inflict 1d4 hit points of damage for every battery drained.
If a hapless target has three batteries in her weapon, 4 in her backpack, and a nearby expedition member has a total of 9 on her person, the grenade would explode--in 0 to 3 units--inflicting 16d4 of damage to all within 3 hexes.

The energy drain grenade cannot affect robot batteries, or power plants.
Psionic batteries get a save vs.
mental attack before losing a battery life.
The psionic attack strength of the grenade attack is 0.
Note that an energy drain grenade could kill a persona using psionic batteries by reducing her MSTR to 0.
The energy drain grenade is also known as an Amp-ire grenade, or a Never-ready.

=== Energy Grenade 

[horizontal]
Range:: PSTR
Area of Effect:: 15h x 15h x 1h
Damage:: 12-48 (12d4)
Wate:: 1kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 5000

The energy grenade emits a controlled lazer explosion of the given volume (15h x 15h x 1h).
Regardless of the terrain in which the grenade is employed, it will always occupy the given volume.
Note that the 1 hex component will always run parallel to gravity.
The grenade's blast area will race along corridors, through open doors, around corners, and down escalators.
Using this weapon in unfamiliar terrain could have its effects hurtling directly back at the user.
The energy grenade is also known as an anti-trench grenade, or a mouser.

=== Exploding Pin Grenade 

[horizontal]
Range:: PSTR
Area of Effect:: 4h
Damage:: 1-6 (1d6) per pin 
Wate:: 1.25kg
EXPS:: 150
Value:: 650

The exploding pin grenade is a sadistic version of a micro grenade launcher.
When an EPG goes off, it showers the 4 hex area of effect with tiny pins.
These tiny pins will stick into the hardest of alloys (AR less than 1000).
When ever a pin hits, it will immediately explode inflicting the 1d6 damage described above.
The number of pins which hit a target depends on it's size.
The larger the target the more pins inflict damage.

include::ROOT:partial$CH45_Table_Pin_Amount.adoc[]

=== Fragmentation Grenade 

[horizontal]
Range:: PSTR
Area of Effect:: 1h
Damage:: 5-50 (5d10)
Wate:: 0.85kg
EXPS:: 125
Value:: 75

The fragmentation grenade is your run of the mill shrapnel grenade.
These are commonly called frags, or grenades.

=== Fusion Grenade 

[horizontal]
Range:: PSTR
Area of Effect:: 10h
Damage:: 10-120 (10d12)
Wate:: 2.5kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 4000

A fusion grenade delivers a micro nuclear explosion.
The explosion includes a host of other nasty effects beyond damage.

.*Fusion Grenade Areas of Effect*
* 10h 10d12 damage
* 15h immolation chance 
* 20h blinding flash
* 30h radiation attack

.*Immolation*
Any flammable object within 15 hexes of the epicenter has a chance of immolating.
This includes personas as well as equipment.
The chance of immolation is equal to 1% per point of damage
Anything ignited by the grenade will burn until extinguished.
This results in burn damage every unit of being on fire.

.*Blinding*
Any personas within 20 hexes has a chance of being blinded.
The chance of being blinded is 1/2% per point of damage.
This attack affects both organic and inorganic personas and devices.
Vision will be restored in 1-10 (1d10) minutes.

.*Radiation*
Any target within 30 hexes is subject to a lethal radiation attack.
The intensity of the attack is equal to 1/10 of the damage.

The effects of a fusion grenade are cumulative, and lethal.
Consider a persona that is within 10 hexes taking 60 HPS of damage.
First she subtracts 60 HPS from HPS Total.
She has a 60% chance of catching fire, and a 30% chance of being blinded.
Finally she must make a roll versus intensity 6 lethal radiation.

.*Residual Radiation*
For effect the ref can make the 10 hex area of effect a lingering radiation zone of an intensity equal to 1/10 of the blast damage.
The radiation zone's intensity level will decrease by one point per hour, day, or week, depending on how dirty the grenade was.

Any reader should have noticed that this is not a close combat weapon, and the even more observant readers have noticed that a fusion grenade cannot be thrown without having some effect on the attacker.
Fusion grenades are also known as micro-nukes, CQ bombs, and tactical nukes.

=== Gas Grenade 

[horizontal]
Range:: PSTR
Area of Effect:: 13h
Damage:: Special
Wate:: 0.9kg    
EXPS:: 275
Value:: 250

The gas grenade discharges a dense mist of poisons.
The nerve agents are both contact, and respiratory poisons.
All organic targets must roll vs poison attack or suffer the described affect.
The cloud of gas will dissipate in 1-8 units.
Prevailing winds may affect the duration, and intensity of the gas cloud.
The gas's intensity will vary from 4-24 (4d6).
This value is generated once for the entire cloud.

The Gas Type Table determines the effect on the persona if their roll vs poison.

include::ROOT:partial$CH44_Table_Gas_Type.adoc[]

=== Gravruptor Grenade 

[horizontal]
Range:: PSTR
Area of Effect:: 25h
Damage:: Special
Wate:: 2kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 6000

The gravruptor grenade generates 1-6 random gravities of anomalous attraction.
The effect will either smash targets into the ground, throw them high into the air, or fling them off into space.
The gravruptor grenade produces an instantaneous burst of random acceleration.
Newtonian physics conveniently need not apply.
Objects greater than 2 tonnes in wate are not affected by this grenade's attack.

There is a 75% chance that the gravruptor grenade will add 1-6 g to the local terrain.
The effects of this should be obvious, as targets crash to the ground, weapons are torn from grasps, and vehicles grind into the dirt.
This pressing problem will also inflict damage to all targets in the area of effect.
This damage is 1 to 12 (1d12) hit points in damage per extra gravity.
E.g., 3 gravities would smash targets into the ground for 3-36 hit points of damage.

When the gravruptor grenade is reversing gravity there will be an acceleration of 1-6 gravities in a direction opposite to the present gravity direction.
The general effect is that things go flying into the air.
All items are lifted 1 hex in the air per anomalous gravity.
There is no damage inflicted on the initial toss up, but the subsequent trip down from 1-6 hexes will inflict substantial damage.
There will be 1-6 hit points of damage inflicted per hex that the target falls through.
If the targets should hit a ceiling, or some other such covering, on the way up they would take 1 to 6 (1d6) hit points per gravity.

All of the above effects are described for a normal gravity world.
What effects this grenade has on high gravity and low gravity planets depends entirely on the ref.

This weapon was designed to be used in zero gravity.
The gravruptor is employed to toss fling enemy combatants off into space.
All targets are subjected to 1 to 6 (1d6) hit points of damage per gravity of acceleration.
They also fly away from the grenade's target hex at 1 h/u for every 2 points of damage.
Consider a gravruptor grenade that generated 5 gravities on detonation
The referee generates 16 HPS of damage on the 5d6 die roll.
Each target would subtract 16 HPS their HPS Total.
They would also fly off at 8 h/u away from the grenade blast. 

The gravruptor grenade is also known as a downer, or a jump bomb.

=== Magnetic Disruptor Grenade 

[horizontal]
Range:: PSTR
Area of Effect:: 12h
Damage:: Special
Wate:: 1.5kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 4500

The magnetic disruptor grenade acts like an implosive super magnet. 
When detonated this grenade attracts loose items towards it's detonation hex.
For example, everything metal within 15h will fly towards the grenade.
These high speed projectiles smash into any persona within the area of effect.
The further out from the epicenter the target is the less damage is delivered.
So a persona 12h out from the target hex would take 1d4 of damage.
A persona in the target hex would take 12d4.
The targets closest to the detonation are being hit with more hurtling stuff.

Anything loose will be violently drawn towards the epicenter. 
The disruptor will attract anything inorganic: metals, alloys, plastic, wood, etc.
Armour may get ripped off of personas.
Tools  may be torn from utility belts.
Weapons can be rended from the paws of personas.
Unless the terrain is intentionally completely barren there will be stuff to attract.
The closer to the epicenter the harder it is to hang onto stuff.
A physical strength attribute roll is required if the referee has targeted something.
The attribute challenge is versus 24 at the epicenter and 2 at the periphery.

Typically the planet is the nearest and largest object. 
In zero gravity the grenade will attach to the largest object nearest the target hex.
Only tiny personas are at risk of being pulled in the magnetic maelstrom.
This grenade has been used to draw a persona back to a space vehicle.

=== Mini Grenade 

[horizontal]
Range:: 1/2 PSTR
Area of Effect:: attack roll
Damage:: 3-18 (3d6)
Wate:: 0.1kg
EXPS:: 170
Value:: 1000

Mini grenades are so small and light that they cannot be thrown very far.
A mini grenade must score a direct hit the target to inflict damage.
A miss with a mini grenade explodes loudly and harmlessly.
The armour rating of the target is determined by it's size. 
Like any grenade the mini grenade does damage regardless of the target's armour rating. 

include::ROOT:partial$CH45_Table_Size_Armour_Rating.adoc[]

Mini grenade users may wish to throw a handful of these micro explosives at their target.
The persona can throw up to three mini grenades at once.
The first grenade attacks at minus 50, the second at minus 75, and the third at minus 100.
Remember that the grenades only need to hit the target, and not penetrate armour to inflict damage.
Mini grenades are also known as pea grenades, or pill grenades.
High tech level mini grenades can become extremely small.

include::ROOT:partial$CH44_Table_Mini_Grenades.adoc[]

Explosive Mini Grenades::
Must make a successful attack roll.
Each grenade that hits inflicts 3-18 (3d6) hit points of damage.
There is no area of effect. 
Only a hit target is damaged. 

Mini Gas Grenades::
Must make a successful attack roll.
Mini gas grenades do no damage unless the poison type does.
Intensity of the gas attack is from 3-18 (3d6).
There is no area of effect.
Only a hit target is affected. 
To determine the gas type jump to <<_gas_grenade,Gas Grenade>>.

Mini Pyrotechnic Grenades::
Mini pyrotechnic grenades are harmless but extremely distracting.
They player need only have the mini grenade land in the target hex. 
This will imbue that hex with distracting shock and awe.
To determine the pyrotechnic type jump to <<_pyrotechnic_grenade, Pyrotechnic Grenade>>.

=== Molecular Disruptor Grenade 

[horizontal]
Range:: PSTR
Area of Effect:: Special
Damage:: 8-64 (8d8)
Wate:: 1.7kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 10000

A molecular disruptor is a temperamental disintegration grenade.
When discharged this grenade converts solid matter into a warm, seething cloud.
The problem is that neither the thrower, nor the grenade, has any idea how much matter is about to be disrupted.
When a molecular disruptor is used the Extent of Disruption is randomly determined.

.*Damage*
The damage area of effect inflicts 8-64 (8d8) hit points of damage. 
The size of the damage area of effect is rolled on the Disruption Event Table. 
Damage is caused by slivers of disintegration that burst from the grenade.
These slivers punch microscopic holes through anything in the damage area of effect.

.*Disintegration*
The disintegration area of effect utterly destroys any target within it. 
Any matter within this area of effect is transformed into homogenous gas.
There is no explosion, no noise, just a giant cloud of effervescent warm gas.
The effect of this on matter is devastating, and final.
All personas, equipment, terrain, and good ideas is utterly destroyed.

The molecular disruption grenade is also known as a disintegration grenade.

include::ROOT:partial$CH45_Table_Disruption_Event.adoc[]

=== Multiple Explosive Grenade 

[horizontal]
Range:: PSTR
Area of Effect:: Special
Damage:: Special
Wate:: 3kg
EXPS:: 250
Value:: 1000

The multiple explosive grenade is the "exploding cigar" of lethal combat.
This grenade initially explodes like any other grenade, but similarities end there.
After the first explosion the grenade flies into the air, only to land and explode again.
The number of detonations, area of effect and damage is determined each time. 

The successive explosions will occur 0 to 3 units apart.
The location of the explosion is 0-5 (1d6-1) hexes in a random direction. 
Easiest way to determine is to make a random facet roll.

include::ROOT:partial$articulate.adoc[]

These grenades are dangerous to the expedition for obvious reasons.
Unless properly identified a multiple explosive grenade is indistinguishable from a regular grenade.
If used indoors the grenade will explode each unit bouncing around the room.

Multiple explosive grenades are also known as jumping jacks.

include::ROOT:partial$CH45_Table_Multiple_Explosions.adoc[]

=== Napalm Grenade 

[horizontal]
Range:: PSTR
Area of Effect:: 2h x 8h
Damage:: 6-60 (6d10)
Wate:: 1.75kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 2000

The napalm grenade is unique in that it has a swath area of effect as opposed to a spherical area of effect.
When the grenade is discharged, it launches itself into the air for an 8 hex trip while raining adhesive flammables all along its course.
Normally this grenade will launch itself in the same direction that it was thrown.
If the thrower is unskilled in grenade combat, and rolls less than 200 on her attack roll the napalm grenade will launch itself in a random direction.

Anything caught in this blazing area of effect will take the damage listed, will immolate, and will continue burning for 2-8 units.
The continued burning will inflict 2-24 hit points of damage each unit.The 2 hex by 8 hex patch of flame will burn itself out in 1 to 10 minutes.
Referees should also be prepared to consider the effects of smoke inhalation, which is unavoidable when this weapon is used in enclosed spaces.
Napalm grenades are also labelled phosphorous grenades and Smoky the Fear bombs.

=== Pin Grenade 

[horizontal]
Range:: 1/4 PSTR
Area of Effect:: 1h
Damage:: 1-10(1d10) per pin
Wate:: 0.5kg
EXPS:: 150
Value:: 500

The pin grenade is the needler of area of effect combat.
The pin grenade pierces everything in 1 hex radius of effect with explosive pins.
The initial detonation is relatively quiet. 
The exploding pins are not much noisier. 

The bigger the target the more pins that stick into it.
Each pin explodes for 1-10 (1d10) hit points of damage.
So a Large target could take up to 12-120 (12d10) hit points of damage.

include::ROOT:partial$CH45_Table_Pin_Amount.adoc[]

There is a 20% chance that a pin grenade will not be explosive.
None explosive pin grenades are loaded with a nerve toxin.
Th

The intensity of the chemical will vary from 3 to 18.
The persona must make a saving throw even if a beneficial pharmaceutical has been placed in the pin grenade.


The pin grenade is also known as a porcupine, or inoculator grenade.

include::ROOT:partial$CH45_Table_Pin_Effect.adoc[]

=== Pyrotechnic Grenade 

[horizontal]
Range:: PSTR
Area of Effect:: 5h
Damage:: None
Wate:: 0.35kg
EXPS:: 100
Value:: 175

Pyrotechnic grenades are smoke, sonic, and flash weapons.
The pyrotechnic grenades are used in military actions or violent magic shows.
Pyro grenades can be devoted to one attack type or a mix of all three. 
A save must be made for each separate type of pyro attack. 

include::ROOT:partial$CH45_Table_Pyro_Combo.adoc[]

Smoke:: 
A smoke grenade fills the area of effect with very dense smoke.
The smoke will dissipate in 1 to 10 minutes.
For a fancy smoke colour jump to the <<_grenade_colour,Colour Table>>.

Flash:: 
Flash grenades will temporarily blind any target that has optical sensors.
The sensors (eyes, cameras) will remain inoperative for 1 to 10 units.
There is a saving throw versus intensity 2 to 16 (2d8) poison.

Sonic:: 
Sonic grenades deliver a painful eardrum numbing howl on discharge.
Any audio receptors in the area of effect are deafened by the attack.
Total deafness lasts 1 to 10 minutes, followed by days of tinnitus.
There is a saving throw versus intensity 2 to 16 (2d8) poison.

=== Radiation Grenade 

[horizontal]
Range:: PSTR
Area of Effect:: 12h
Damage:: 3-24 (3d8)
Wate:: 2.8kg
EXPS:: 200
Value:: 1000

The radiation grenade douses the area of effect with lethal radiation types.
Any target caught in the bath area will take 3 to 24 hit points of damage.
There is a simultaneous radiation attack of intensity equal to the damage rolled. 
If the blast doesn't get you the radiation will.
The radiation grenade is completely silent. 
Not unlike the creeper of grenades.

The grenade attack leaves ongoing lethal residual radioactivity. 
The area of effect will remain toxic one day per intensity of radiation.
A radiation intensity 12 attack would remain for 12 days. 
The intensity decreases by 1 per day until there is no lethal radiation.
The detonation site will remain anomalous to a radiation detectors forever.

The radiation grenade is also known as a Neutron grenade, or a Micrograve.

=== Skylighter Grenade 

[horizontal]
Range:: PSTR
Area of Effect:: 40h x 40h rectangle
Damage:: 4-40 (4d10)
Wate:: 2.95kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 5500

The sky lighter is an outdoorsy grenade.
On detonation the grenade launches a projectile into the sky.
After 2-6 (3d3) unites the enormous area of effect is deluged with jagged hail.
The initial explosion does no damage, but the hailstorm is like nails that melt.
This grenade depends on complex meteorological mechanisms.
This grenade is useless if used indoors, underwater, in zero gravity or in a vacuum.

The sky lighter grenade is also known as a Painmaker, Rainmaker, or Chicken Little.

=== Torc Grenade 

[horizontal]
Range:: PSTR
Area of Effect:: 12h
Damage:: 12-144 (12d12)
Wate:: 1.75
EXPS:: 275
Value:: 9000

The torc grenade is the anti-force field grenade.
A torc grenade does no damage unless the target is within a force field.
The grenade affects any force field makes contact with the radius of the torc grenade.
Any tactical, personal or battery powered force field will instantly be exhausted.
A force field powered by a renewable power plant return in 1 to 10 minutes.
The torc grenade cannot damage a civic or naval forcefield. 
The torc grenade will have no effect what so ever on force fields greater than 24 hexes in radius.
The grenade may create a temporary hole in such force fields to assist the story.

The collapse of the shield delivers 12-144 (12d12) hit points of damage.
The damage is only delivered to targets inside the force field. 

The torc grenade is also known as a force field disruptor.

== Grenade Attribute Explanations

=== Range 
Grenades consume the hex that they explode in, and must be thrown a safe distance to avoid damaging the user.
The range of a grenade depends entirely on the thrower, and is equal to her PSTR in hexes.
Close counts in horseshoes and hand grenades. 
A miss with a grenade can still inflict damage to the target. 

=== Area Of Effect 
Area of effect represents the radius of the sphere affected by the grenade.
For example, a fragmentation grenade has an area of effect of 1 hex.
Any target with the target hex and the surrounding hex is affected.
This includes targets above the target hex because area of effect is spherical.
Fellow expedition members can be included in this area of effect.

=== Damage 
This is the hit point range that is inflicted upon any target caught within the area of effect.
Grenades with special effects have no damage range.
Damage is rolled once, and each target in the area of effect is damaged.
There is no saving roll against damage.
The damage is not divided amongst the targets and each takes the same amount.

=== Wate 
This is the wate of the grenade in kilograms.

=== EXPS 
Experience points are earned for identifying the grenade.
The EXPS award is the whether the grenade is identified before or after detonation

=== Value 
The value of a grenade, or aerosol, is the value of one charge.
In some cases aerosols can generate more than one charge, but even with these modifications such aerosols still have the same value.

=== Amount 
A grenade cache will contain 1-6 (1d6) grenades.
For powerful, campaign altering, grenades one will suffice.

=== Trigger 
To make the subject of grenades a little more confusing there are several different types of fuses.
For the convenience of the ref 9 out of 10 grenades are detonated by contact with the target hex, or any substantially solid object along its path.
All other grenades will have timers, and will explode 0 to 3 units after being thrown.
Before a grenade will detonate, it must be triggered, and thrown.
A list of several different trigger types are given on Table 45.2: Grenade Trigger.
The trigger types do not require explanation, and simply indicate what must be done to activate the grenade.
For example, an inertia trigger is activated when the grenade goes through a throwing motion, and a twist trigger will active when some device is twisted on the grenade.

include::ROOT:partial$CH45_Table_Grenade_Trigger.adoc[]

=== Description 
Not all grenades are created equal. 
Even the same grenade type may have different shapes and colours.
The different appearance of the grenades comes from the tech layering in EXP.
Different companies, species, technologies, and regulations are all mixed together.
Grenades lack identifying markings.
Identification must be made by feel, and other indicators.
Expeditions often blow themselves fiddling with grenades.

==== Grenade Shape
The bomb shape table is used purely for the convenience of the author.

include::ROOT:partial$CH44_Table_Bomb_Shape.adoc[]

==== Grenade Shape Deformation
The bomb shape deformation table is used purely for the convenience of the author.
