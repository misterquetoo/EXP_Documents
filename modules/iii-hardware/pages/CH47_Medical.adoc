= Veterinary Equipment

Veterinary equipment is designed to repair organic machines.
Each piece of vet equipment performs its own private miracle, but nothing does everything, and some things do nothing.
Even though the equipment is highly advanced, the equipment still requires some input from so-called professionals.
Veterinarians are the primary users of vet artifacts.
Most artifacts merely require a single vet to point the device correctly.
While other artifacts require an entire xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH14_Performance_Tables.adoc#_research_teams[Research Teams].

Hopefully, vet equipment will not only be used to repair the wounded from battle, but to heal the sick, aid the needy, and other humanitarian efforts (ha!).
The attributes of vet equipment are detailed in the following paragraphs.

== Veterinary Equipment Type 

include::ROOT:partial$CH47_Table_Medical_Equipment.adoc[]

== Veterinary Equipment Types

=== Age Determiner 

[horizontal]
Duration:: 5 years
Bonuses:: +20 age related rolls, +10 time related rolls
Wate:: 1kg
EXPS:: 200
Value:: 5000

The age determiner estimates the age of organic personas.
The biological age of whatever the little black box is pointed at shows on a screen.
The device would require adjustment to be used on microscopic organisms.
The age determiner has off label uses that come in handy. 
The device can help detect a disguise, notice a time space aberration, or detect an ambush.


=== Anesthetics Mask 

[horizontal]
Duration:: 5 hours
Bonuses:: +30 surgery; +40 on comfort
Wate:: 1.2kg
EXPS:: 10
Value:: 6000

An anesthetics mask looks like a gas mask with dials and indicators.
The mask will render any organic anthro unconscious for the time set on the mask.
This is a pain free state similar to being maintained under general anesthetic.
However no pharmacological agents are employed.
Once applied the mask immediately takes over.
It is virtually impossible to subject an unwilling patient to the anesthetics mask.

The mask should not be prematurely removed from the subject.
If the anthro is not returned to consciousness by the mask badness can happen.
There is a 2% chance that unconsciousness will persist for 1-100 days.
The mask can only anesthetize one anthro at a time.


=== Anti Aging Beam 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Power Source
Bonuses:: +40 age related rolls
Wate:: 150kg
EXPS:: 200
Value:: 50000

This machine bastes the organic persona with information encoded energy.
This data can technomagically reprogram cells that are aging adversely.
Treatments take place over 1-4 (1d4) days and last an hour each.
Any treatment interruptions require the treatment to start over.
Getting injured in combat would be considered a treatment interruption.

The beam is not a fountain of youth.
This artifact repairs unnatural aging that the persona has been subject to.
For instance, aging due to chrono attack weapons, or special drive accidents.

The anti aging beam heals 3-30 (3d10) years per chronologic damage.
The de-aging process does not heal lost attributes.
To repair damaged attributes requires a <<_rejuv_chamber,Rejuv Chamber>>.
A persona aged to 52 years suffers PSTR and DEX penalties.
The anti aging beam could repair the chronologic years but not the attribute drops.

The persona remains phenotypically the same.
The anti-aging beam cannot turn an adult into a child.
If the persona is accidentally aged to less than 1 year she is dead.
Over use of the anti-aging beam can easily kill the patient.

A vet can adjust the amount of de-aging carried out. 
The more control she needs the higher the degree of difficulty.

=== Anti Mutation Beam 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Power Source
Bonuses:: +30 mutation related rolls
Wate:: 150kg
EXPS:: 2000
Value:: 200000

This machine bastes the organic persona with information encoded energy.
This data can technomagically reprogram cells that have mutated.
The beam can be used to restructure personas into their original organic forms.

The artifact is good for removing defective mutations.
However it cannot tell the difference between defective and advantaged mutations.
The beam also only works on mutations.
It would have no effect on an alien's mutation like natural ability.
The beam would have no effect on a robotic peripheral that mimics a mutation.
If the robot or alien developed a mutation after fabrication or evolution this beam would work.

While under the beam physical mutations shrivel up and fall off the mutant.
Mental mutations simply stop working.
If a player feels that her mutation is an ability or evolutionary trait the xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH16_Special_Rolls_Asshole.adoc[Sphincter Dice] can be consulted.

The persona must fail a poison roll for the mutation to be affected by the beam.
The intensity of the beam is 2-12 (2d6) plus the vet's experience level and skills.
The player can swap the direction of the poison roll if they do not want to lose the mutation. 
Anti mutant groups can use the beam to punish mutated anthros.
The player uses CON for physical mutation and MSTR for mental mutations.

The beam has a 40 cm range, and its effect is instantaneous and irreversible.

If a veterinarian wishes to focus the beam she must win a performance roll.
Physical mutations add 3DD per physical mutation.
Mental mutations add 10DD per mental mutation.
If a vet wanted to eliminate a mutant's pus producing organ, while retaining her symbiotic attachment and pyrokinesis the vet would have to make a 16DD maneuver.

=== Anti Virus Beam 

[horizontal]
Duration:: 200 unit per Battery
Bonuses:: +20 on infection rolls
Wate:: 5kg + Battery
EXPS:: 1000
Value:: 100000

The anti-virus beam will damage foreign micro-organisms infiltrating an organic substance.
This includes viral, bacterial, fungal, or prion infection.
The beam will not kill symbiotic organisms that are good for the persona.
This super-sterilizer has a range of 75 cm.

This usually does *not* include nano machines or exoplanetary micro-organisms.
Whether this works on a robot with an organic infection requires xref:ii-roll_playing_rules:CH16_Special_Rolls_Asshole.adoc[Sphincter Dice].


=== Auto Tourniquet 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Unlimited
Bonuses:: +20 limb or bleeding rolls
Wate:: 1.5kg
EXPS:: 250
Value:: 750

An automatic tourniquet can be wrapped over or near any major source of blood loss.
The tourniquet is more than just an automated constricting bandage.
This artifact employs electrical impulses to constrict the appropriate vessels. 
The tourniquet can assist on a severely damaged limb, internal bleed, or head wound.
If the tourniquet has safety mechanisms to prevent malicious placement.
The auto tourniquet does not heal damage, but does prevent further damage.
The electric tourniquet will always function (no batteries necessary) if attached to a warm organic creature.
Veterinarians earn +20 on any PT rolls that involve blood loss (surgery to severe trauma).

//+++<figure id="attachment_5326" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5326" style="width: 245px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i2.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/medicalthing.471.png?resize=245%2C183[Staples, sutures, bandages.Anaesthetic?,245]](https://i2.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/medicalthing.471.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5326" class="wp-caption-text">+++Staples, sutures, bandages Anaesthetic?+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

The Blood congelator activates the clotting pathways freezing the flow of blood.
Any persona can use the device can be used to create scabs on surface bleeding.
Only a vet can use a blood congelator to control internal bleeding.
To control internal bleeding is a DD3 maneuver with a blood congelator.
When combatting blood loss the vet will earn +20 on her PT roll.

Weaponizing this device yields unpredictable results.
Each attack drains 300 units of battery power.
Six attacks would drain a full battery.
It attacks as a type C weapon with a next hex maximum range.
A successful attack roll will inflict 2-12 (2d6) hit points of clotting damage.
A hit is followed by a chance of a major embolus.
There is 1% chance per hit point of damage of causing a major embolus.

Duration:: 90 minutes per Battery
Bonuses:: +20 for bone related rolls
Wate:: 8kg + Battery
EXPS:: 1500
Value:: 3000

The Bone Setter accelerates the repair of any anthro's structural elements.
Structural elements includes bones, cellulose, exoskeletons or mutated limbs. 
Fractures, cavities, cancers, deformities, and ligaments are technomagically repaired.

A treatment uses 1-10 minutes of a 90 minute charge.
Any persona can use the bone setter to heal 1-6 (1d6) of damage to obvious trauma.
A vet can extend this healing into daily rehab.
The bone setter cannot be weaponized.

=== Breath Ball 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Single use
Bonuses:: +25 for resuscitation related procedures.
Wate:: 500gm
EXPS:: 1500
Value:: 3000

The breath ball is a temporary self contained ventilation gas exchanger.
A conscious persona can stuff the ball into her ventilation orifice to breath safely.
The ball will offer oxygen or carbon dioxide (florians) to the breathing persona.
This allows personas to breath under water.
The breath ball also filters out respiratory poisons from the air. 
The ball basically will work for a few hours to get the persona through a tight pinch.
This device does not act as long term life support or protect against exatmo.

A vet can use the ball to both ventilate and oxygenate an unconscious persona.

A vet can jam the breath ball into an unconscious persona's digestion orifice.
The ball will take over ventilation and oxygen exchange for hours. 
In the case of florians carbon dioxide is delivered.
The breath ball will maintain the persona for a few minutes to get through a tight pinch.
This device does not act as long term life support or protect against exatmo.

There is no way to weaponize a breath ball.


=== Cardio Vest 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Single use
Bonuses:: +25 for resuscitation related procedures.
Wate:: 2.9kg 
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 1200

Any persona can put this vest on to regulate and monitor cardiac pump function.
If needed the cardio vest will rhythmically contract pumping the heart and lungs.
This will keep vital fluids moving regardless if it is blood or sap.
The cardio vest will maintain the persona for a few minutes to get through a tight pinch.
This device does not act as long term life support.

There is no way to weaponize a breath ball.

=== Cerebro Converter 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Power Source
Bonuses:: +30 on thinkspace rolls
Wate:: 1000kg
EXPS:: 10000
Value:: 11300000000

A cerebro converter can analyze and copy any organic storage device.
In most cases this will be an anthro brain.
The information is converted to electrical storage, and becomes  transferrable.
The cerebro converter switches a consciousness from one brain to another.
Some of its uses include brainwashing, ultimate disguises, and immortality.

The cerebro conversion transfers the consciousness of one anthro into another.
This moves the emotions, memories, skills, and mental strength between brains.
The brain receiving the consciousness has it's previous consciousness obliterated.
The body which the consciousness left becomes a vegetative husk.
The converted consciousness now lives in a new body.
The physical attributes of the new body do not change. 
AWE, CHA, CON, DEX, PSTR and HPS remain the same.
There is a new INT, MSTR, personality, memories, vocation and EXPS in the new brain. 

IMPORTANT: *These actions are ethically dubious and medically dangerous.*

Cerebro conversion is a dangerous maneuver for the personas, players and the referee.
For the personas, there is a high chance of death, insanity, and mental loss.
The users must be aware that the cerebro converter is indiscriminate, and all knowledge (family life, loves, hates, gossip) is transferred into the receiving brain.
This can cause an infinity of problems. 
If properly exploited by the referee can translate into an endless source of fun.
Any procedure failure, like a power failure, interruption by combat, or a failed performance roll will result in an adverse effect.
The adverse effects of cerebro conversion are drastic indeed.

Success::
The base chance for success of the cerebro conversion is the ratio between the receiver's INT and the donor's combined INT and MSTR.

=== Chance of Cerebro Conversion Success
.(INT + MSTR of donor) / (INT + MSTR receiver)
****
It is more difficult to wipe a more intelligent mind. +
The referee may include experience level on either side of the fraction.
****

For example, the donor has a 6 INT and 6 MSTR and the receiver has a 9 INT and a 9 MSTR.
There is a 66% (12/18) chance of the cerebro conversion being successful.
More often than not the chance of successful conversion will be >100% 
Personas that have inorganic brains and therefore no mental strength have a 25 INT.

.*There are two parts required for success*
For the cerebro conversion to be a success the vet must also win a performance roll.
Even if the conversion is successful the vet can still mess up the procedure.
It is strongly recommended to build xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH14_Performance_Tables.adoc#_research_teams[Research Teams] for this performance roll.

Failure:: 
If the conversion roll is a failure there can be no conversion.
The vet can prevent an adverse effect by winning a performance roll.
If the conversion fails and the vet fails there is a side effect.

If the vet fails her performance roll and conversion was a success nothing happens.
There is no conversion and there are no side effects

Machine Failure:: 
The cerebro converter has a chance of breaking under the duress of a failed conversion.
If both the conversion and the vet fail their rolls the machine may malfunction.
The chance of machine failure and damage is 1% per DD of maneuver.
So if the degree of difficulty is 20 there is a 20% chance of machine break down.
Jump to xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH21_Artifact_Damage.adoc#_extent_of_damage[Equipment Damage] to see how bad things are.

Brain Failure:: 
Many of the cerebro conversion side effects are serious.
They often involve competition between two partially converted consciousnesses.
Both consciousnesses are radically altered in preparation for conversion.
Brain failures affect both of the persona brains and consciousnesses.

include::ROOT:partial$CH47_Table_Cerebro_Converter_Side_Effects.adoc[]

Insanity::
There is a minor mixing of consciousnesses and a battle for control. 
This battle is expressed as a fresh new insanity in the mixed up brain.
Each persona is afflicted with an insanity.
The referee can force the player to win a MSTR roll or succumb to the insanity.
Jump to xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH11_Referee_Personas_Anthro.adoc#_introverted[mild insanity] for some inspiration.

Mind Blank::
All data banks, levels of experience, memories, skills, are wiped clean.
This applies to any storage format attached to the cerebro converter.
Most often a brain gets blanked but computers, robots and AI are susceptible.
A player persona must win a mental strength roll or get blanked.
A referee persona getting blanked depends on the story.
The duration of the fugue is also based on the story.
Figments of memory can be a wonderful tool to aid story progress.

Dominance::
Dominance is a confusing mix of two consciousnesses.
Each consciousness has been copied without the previous one being erased.
The two consciousnesses coexist in two different brains and battle for dominance.

Dominance calls on the improvisational talents of the referee and the players.
The most common way to run this adverse effect is as follows:
The dominant mental strength rules it's own brain most of the time.
The less dominant consciousness will appear at inopportune moments to improve the story.
This may swap the bodies between two personas and therefore players.
So two players, a player and a referee or two referee personas may be swapping back and forth.
The dominance of their brain and body changing along with their persona record sheets.

This consciousness dominance battle crosses organic and inorganic consciousnesses.
If a player is trying to dominate her persona she must win an intelligence roll.
It is possible for dominance to end the playable life of a player persona.

The cerebro converter comes with a warning to personas, players and referees. 

Death::
Death by cerebro converter is total.
The persona's consciousness is wiped along with all essential unconscious supports.
Organics are mind blanked along with all cardiorespiratory autoregulatory mechanisms.
Inorganics are erased along with all support daemons. 
All that is left after cerebro converter death is a lifeless husk.

Each persona, or device, on the cerebro converter must win a mental strength roll or die.
Robots use their intelligence as mental strength for this attack.
The MSTR roll goes against the degree of difficulty of the vet maneuver.
So lower tech converters are more likely to kill their patients. 

Mental Mutation:: 
Each persona must win a mental strength roll or suffer a xref:v-wetware:CH58_Mental.adoc#_defective_mutations[Defective Mental Mutation].
The mental strength is up against the DD of the vet maneuver for the converter.
If a referee is feeling generous the player may roll on the 
xref:v-wetware:CH58_Mental.adoc#_mutation_type[Mental Mutation Table]. 

.*Less Failure Through Science*
The higher the tech level of the cerebro converter, the more effective the device is.
The tech level of the cerebro converter is represented by it's wate.
The impacts of tech level on artifacts is cover in xref:iv-software:CH56_Tech_Level.adoc[Tech Level].
The tech level of the cerebro converter is represented by it's wate.
The lower the converter's wate the higher it's tech level.

When the degree of difficulty to operate the machine is high xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH14_Performance_Tables.adoc#_research_teams[Research Teams] are recommended.
A research team can be composed vets and biologists.
Occasionally other vocations can be added to the research team.

The Cerebro Converter Tech table limits the type of conversion that can be completed.
A low tech cerebro converter can only transpose a consciousness between similar patients.
As the tech level increases more complex transfers are possible.

=== Cloning Equipment 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Power Source
Bonuses:: +20 on cloning related rolls
Wate:: 2500kg
EXPS:: 25000
Value:: 5000000000

Cloning Equipment functions like a biologic printer building an exact organic replica.
The clone will is a verbatim cellular construct.
It is an autonomous statue made from made from matching meats and ligaments.

NOTE: *To copy the body and consciousness of a sample requires both cloning equipment and a cerebro converter.*

However the consciousness of the sample is not transferred.
The fresh body lacks personality, mental strength and training of the cloned brain.
The clone copies the cellular maturity, but not the vocation or experience.
The sample has no control over the clone.
The clone cannot speak, and usually becomes a referee persona.

Sample Size::
The more advanced the cloning equipment the less of a sample is needed.
A low tech cloning machine needs to have a living body present for the entire process.
This is very time  consuming and can be dangerous for the living sample.
A high tech cloning machine needs only to have a small chunk of the organism present.
Cloning is a slightly destructive process and the sample can be damaged or destroyed.
Little bits of the sample are snipped off and homogenized into genetic components.

Cloning Success::
The cloning process is not automated and requires a xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH14_Performance_Tables.adoc#_research_teams[Research Team] of vets and biologists.
The research team rolls are made at the end of the cloning process. 

Shortening the cloning process introduces an new chance of failure.
The cloning process takes 1 day per degree of difficulty.
For example, a 30 DD clone takes 30 days to brew.
If the team decides to speed up the brewing process to 15 days there a 50% (15/30) chance of failure.
The team can try and rescue the speed clone by making another roll at double the degree of difficulty.

Most often a clone brew will fail catastrophically.
The tank will contain a jumbling blob of bones, tubes, organs and rumpled skin.

Machine Failure::
If the cloning process fails there is a 1% chance per DD of the maneuver of the machine breaking down.
So if the degree of difficulty is 20 there is a 20% chance of machine break down.
Jump to xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH21_Artifact_Damage.adoc#_extent_of_damage[Equipment Damage] to see how bad things are.

The box comes with a random and limited list of pharma.
There is no limit to the number of pharmaceuticals the drug box can learn.
The drug box does *not* analyze and copy meds.
The drug box is not a pharmaceutical photocopier. 

include::ROOT:partial$CH47_Table_Drug_Box_Start.adoc[]

New pharmaceuticals must be added by either a drug analyzer or software.
There is a 1% chance per tech level of drug box that a <<_drug_analyzer,Drug Analyzer>> is built in.
A tech level 12 drug box has a 12% of being combined with a drug analyzer.
The drug analyzer increases the wate and value of the drug box.

Successful fabrication of a pharmaceutical does not require a veterinarian.
However a veterinarian's input decreases the chance of adverse effects.
xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH14_Performance_Tables.adoc#_research_teams[Research Teams] may be required for fancy rare medications.
The difficulty of the maneuver depends on the chance of adverse effects.

=== Life Ray 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Power Source
Bonuses:: Nil
Wate:: 1250kg
EXPS:: 10000
Value:: 22100010042

A life ray will resurrect deceased organic tissue into a living state.
Enormous energy surges (like lightning) are used to rehydrate desiccated cells, restore chemical equilibriums, and rebalance biological polarities.
The Life Ray is a machine, and the deceased must be placed within it.

The Life Ray must be employed within 42 hours of death.
The life ray will faithfully restore the body to the from that is presented to it.
The ray does not heal or repair the body.
Any corrective surgery must be completed before the life ray is activated.
For instance a limb would only be reconnected to the regenerated patient only if her arm were properly reconnected before the restoration procedure.

To properly activate the life ray is a veterinarian only maneuver.
The difficulty is 1 DD per hour since death. 
For example, a patient that has been dead for 6 hours would be a DD6 maneuver.
A <<_stasis_bag,Stasis Bag>> arrests the decomposition of death.
With a stasis bag the DD is dependent on how long it took to get the body into the bag.
4 hours after dying would be a 4DD maneuver to operate the life ray.

The life ray is not a healing device. 
The persona will be restored to zero HPS and regain consciousness.
Missing limbs do not grow back. 
Attributes are not restored. 
Pain will continue.

The life ray cannot restore a persona with a zeroed attribute.
So a persona who has zero physical strength is permanently dead.
Charisma is the only attribute that can decrease to zero.

Death leads to decrepitude. 
Every attribute is damaged by the death experience.
A rebooted persona suffers the following attribute penalties.
AWE, CHA, CON, DEX, INT, PSTR and HPS maximum will lose 0 to 3 points (d4-1).
If the persona zeroes one of her attributes during a life ray treatment she is permanently dead.

There is a chance that the death experience will increase a persona's mental strength.
A dead consciousness may develop a stronger link to the thinkspace. 
The first time a life ray reboots a persona her mental strength may jump by 3 points.
The personas adds 0-3 (1d4-1) to MSTR.
Further life ray treatments subject the persona's MSTR to a -1 to +1 (1d-2) attribute adjustment.
Eventually everything succumbs to entropy and dies. 

If any of the persona's attributes fall below one, she is permanently dead.

Once the body is technically restored by the machine, the persona must be brought back to life.

Unless the life ray is employed with precision it can seriously imbalance a campaign.
The premise that all personas who keep dying will eventually die.
If a life ray does not fit into the milieu of the campaign the referee can discard it and have the player roll a different device.

Once applied the wrap's effect is immediate and any further damage is arrested.
The wrap will heal up to 30 hit points of specific skin damage.

include::ROOT:partial$CH47_Table_Medi_Wrap_Type.adoc[]

A veterinarian can extending a vedi wrap to cover multiple smaller wounds. 
This would allow one vedi wrap to be used multiple times.
This is a flat 3DD maneuver.
Only veterinarians can extend a vedi wrap.

A veterinarian can use a vedi wrap to cover different injury types.
This would allow a chemical burns wrap to be used for a thermal burn.
This a flat 3DD maneuver.

=== Mood Ball 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Unlimited
Bonuses:: +20 in emotion related rolls
Wate:: 2.1kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 25000

The mood ball will alter and maintain the disposition of the persona holding it.
If they are depressed it will make them happy, if they get angry it will calm them down.
The mood ball is a psychiatric device that employs electrical signals and inaudible sounds to maintain socially acceptable personalities from the user.
The mood ball is not a mind control device.
The user is aware that she is employing the ball for her own benefit, since they will be genuinely happier when the ball is activated.

A persona that is frequently subjected to the emotional adjustments of the mood ball may become dependant on the device.
The mood ball cannot be used to negate reasonable emotions, but may make them more tolerable.

When a mood ball is used to manipulate a persona they get a a psionic roll.
Winning the save roll prevents the mood ball from having any emotional effect.

=== Mutation Detector 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Unlimited
Bonuses:: +25 on mutation related rolls
Wate:: 1kg
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 25000

This handy little box analyzes personas to detect mutations.
There is one light for physical mutations and one light for mental mutations.
This device does not detect the evolved powers of aliens.
If the alien has mutated then the detector will sound off.

If a target has physical and mental mutations both lights sound off.
The detector does not reveal anything about the nature of the mutation.
A mutation detector has a next hex range and does not work through obstructions.

=== Neuro Cap 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Unlimited
Bonuses:: Nil
Wate:: 80gm
EXPS:: 200
Value:: 90000

The cap generates a think space interference that prevents psionic intrusion.
The device looks like an oversized beanie with a blinking light on top.
The neuro cap will not defend against mental attacks that manipulate the environment.
For example cryokinesis and life leech don't pass through the think space to work.
However, ESP, and mental control would be blocked by the neuro cap.

Mental attacks must first win a roll against a the persona's doubled mental strength.
A persona with a 15 MSTR would have a psionic barrier 30.
If the persona's MSTR were 6, her neuro barrier would be 20.
A  Neuro Cap is just a machine, and offers no other benefits to the persona wearing it. 

A mutant must remove a neuro cap before she can unleash any mental mutation at all.
While wearing a neuro cap on she must win a psionic roll versus double her MSTR before using a mental mutation.  

=== Poison Detector 

// insert table 631

The poison detector can forewarn the expedition of unconfined toxic materials, and give diagnostic information about poisoned patients.
The detector has a 10 hex directional range, and will give an idea of the poison's toxicity (poison intensity).
Contacting the detector to a poisoned patient's body will give vets essential information about the patient.
The poison detector gives vets +25 their PT roll when treating poisoned personas.
A bonus of +10 on PT rolls is granted to nomads, biologists, and vets doing research with the aid of the poison detector.
The detector will indicate whether the poisonous materials are of a radioactive, corrosive, or biochemically toxic nature.

== 39) Poison Box 

// insert table 1060

A Poison Box will detect, locate and identify any amount of toxic substances within a 20 hex radius.
If a Poison Box can obtain one gram of a particular poison, it can synthesize 10 doses of antidote.
Synthesis of antidote requires 1 to 8 hours of battery use.
If the antidote is taken immediately after the poison attack, the persona will get an additional saving throw where the persona's CON will be doubled against that specific poison attack.
If the antidote is not present, and no medical aid is available the persona can be attached to the poison box, and the continued effects of the poison will be stopped.
The persona cannot act, but will not take damage from the poison until the machine runs out of power.

If medical attention is present, a vet using this device will get +115 on her PT rolls when working against poison.
Biologists and nomads will get +40 on poison related PT rolls when using the poison box.
This device has no effect if the persona is already dead.
Only under the most extreme circumstances can the poison box be altered to generate poisons.
This goes against every nanocircuit in the device's programming, to attempt this should be at least a 25DD mechanic maneuver.

== 40) Psionic Box 

// insert table 632

The psionic box is like a psionic stethoscope.
.
The device contains materials that absorb psionic energy wavelengths, and frequency generators that can constructively, or destructively interfere with think space wave forms.
The veterinarian can use the psionic box to probe the local area (15 hex) for psionic anomaly.
The box is an elaborate detector that will betray the presence of any mental mutations (but not physical mutations), or manipulations of a psionic nature.
For instance the psionic box could be used to eavesdrop on telepathic conversations, or send out simplistic psionic signals.
Any psionic related PT rolls attempted by the device's user will gain a bonus of +102.

If the hair net like extension of the device is attached to the scalp of a suspected mutant, there is a chance of determining what mental mutations the persona has.
Not which mental mutation it is, but what it does.
Time stop mutation would reveal the ability to manipulate time, and not something called time stop.
If the persona saves versus mental attack of intensity 4 to 24, the psionic box will yield no information.
The level of the veterinarian making the assessment can be added to the intensity, increasing her chances of success.
Such a probe will take 1 to 100 units of melodramatic agony.
 This requires a successful maneuver of DD12 for a veterinarian (DD16 for biologists).
If this device happens to be combined with a cerebro converter, the victim's mind can be searched like a roll-a-dex for vital information.

== 41) Race Determiner 

// insert table 633

This unit analyzes skin, bone, blood and tissue composition to determine the racial stock of the subject.
The subject can be either dead, or alive.
The data is yielded after 1 to 20 units of the determiner's analyzing the subject.
Vets and biologists can enter information on new races, and program the device to identify them.
A Biologist will receive a bonus of +30 on her PT roll when making identification maneuvers with a race determiner.
Vets can earn a +10 bonus on their PT rolls when making identification type maneuvers with this device.
One battery set will last 5000 units.

== 42) Rejuv Chamber 

// insert table 634

The rejuv chamber is a tank like device that is capable of healing virtually any damage provided that the patient is still alive.
It will remove bullets, replace burned skin;
set and pin bones, excise tumours, drain swellings, trephinate, realign blood chemistry, filter out toxins, and groom the patient's hair, nails and skin.
After a stint in a rejuv chamber the patient will feel refreshed, clean, and alive.

The rejuv chamber can only work with the material that is presented to it.
The chamber will repair nerves with bits of nerve it excises from other parts of the patient.
It will culture muscle from one leg to replace it in the other.
Through this shifting of bodily materials the rejuv chamber can restore lost hit points and decreased attributes.
The rejuv chamber has some limits as to what it can accomplish when healing.
The rejuv chamber will restore a persona to a full hit points total.
It will also restore to full any one attribute that has been reduced for any reason (aging, disease, poison).
If the persona has more than one attribute below normal, the restored attribute will be randomly determined.
A Rejuv Chamber cannot restore MSTR or cure insanity.

Since the rejuv chamber uses the patient's own body tissue to repair damage, there is some risk when the machine is used.
A patient should not use the rejuv chamber to repair herself if she is at a positive HPS total.
The rejuv chamber will scavenge bits of tissue that are essential to the persona's attributes to repair the HPS damage.
The rejuv chamber will return the hit points to full, but at the expense of a randomly selected attribute.
The persona will get all her hit points back, but a fifth of the healed hit points will be subtracted from a randomly selected attribute, this can quite easily kill the persona.
If the persona has a reduced attribute the rejuv chamber will repair the decreased attribute.

If a persona with a HPS max of 35 were to hop into a rejuv chamber with a 15 HPS total and no damaged attributes she would be healed to full.
The 20 HPS* *that she was healed would result in 4 points being subtracted from a random attribute.
If the persona only had a 4 PSTR, and PSTR was the selected attribute the rejuv chamber would have accidentally killed her.

If a persona enters the rejuv chamber at a negative hit points total she will be repaired to her HPS* *maximum without any attribute penalties.
A Rejuv Chamber will also remove parasitic infestations, diseases, poison effects, and non permanent pharmaceuticals without affecting a persona's attributes.
If the patient is at full hit points, and full attributes, the rejuv chamber will remove tumours, and give wonderful manicures without deleterious effects.

One treatment requires an uninterrupted 16 hours in the coffin like tank of the rejuv chamber.
Interrupting a rejuv chamber treatment will usually kill a patient instantly, and messily.
The chamber is largely self directed and will automatically begin to operate when a patient is closed under the lid.
Veterinarians can manipulate the rejuv chamber to assist them is surgical operations and medical maneuvers involving extreme trauma.
A veterinarian enjoys a bonus of +50 on virtually any medical procedure when using a rejuv chamber.

== 43) Respirator 

// insert table 635

A Respirator will monitor, regulate and restore respiration in oxygen users.
Worn over the nose and mouth, this unit will monitor an anthropomorph's respiration without any battery drain.
If it notices any respiratory irregularities, it will start to breath for the persona.
The device will filter out toxic substances in the air, but does not have its own air supply.
The Respirator will warn of heart stoppage, but will continue operating regardless for 5 hours (9000 units), or until disconnected.
This artifact can be combined with a cardio vest to maintain life.
A respirator will assist a veterinarian with +15 to any resuscitation PT rolls.

== 44) Scalpel 

// insert table 636

This lazer Scalpel is very exacting, and makes adjustable shallow incisions.
A scalpel will easily cut through any organic covering.
As a weapon, it does little damage, a d6 hit points if a hit is scored, with no PSTR* *bonus.
When attacking, the scalpel gets +200 to hit against organics, and attacks as a type C weapon.
A lazer scalpel offers a +15 bonus for PT roll to vets, or biologists, engaging in any cutting procedure.
The portable unit will run for 5 hours (9000 units).

== 45) Stasis Bag 

// insert table 637

The stasis bag is the body bag of the future.
All organic processes are arrested within the bag.
This means that there is no decomposition, no need for respiration, and no need for food.
The stasis bag will suspend any organic material in a steady state: lunches;
bodies, limbs, eyes for the eye bank, and even whole unconscious organisms.
The auto-embalmer cannot hold an unwilling occupant, and anyone could thrash their way out of the thin container.

A Stasis Bag will operate safely between 80°C and +80°C.
Stasis Bags that are not successfully opened by a vet or biologist (DD5) have a 1% chance per year of storage of explosive spoiling.
Spoiled contents will be asphyxiated, dead, or under accelerated aromatic decomposition.
One bag can hold 150 kg.
Larger bags increase in value (+1000 ) and wate (+200 gm) for every additional 150 kg of capacity.

== 46) Touch Gloves 

// insert table 638

Touch gloves appear as thin surgical gloves.
When pulled on they melt into the skin, locating the touch and pressure receptors in the persona's digits.
The gloves amplify the receptor's sensitivity, and spread out their area of effect.
This produces hypersensitive touch of such clarity that the user can almost feel air molecules careening off her fingertips.
The gloves cannot be removed, but will wear off in about 1 to 4 days.
Industrious washing can remove the gloves sooner.

Anyone wearing touch gloves will enjoy a general bonus of +1 on her AWE, and a specific AWE bonus of +3 when touch is involved.
There are other more specific benefits gathered in various situations.
Any persona who has lost her sense of touch will have it restored in the hands, and her AWE* *returned to normal.
Mechanics get +20 on PT rolls for delicate repairs.
Veterinarians get +15 on all non-surgery PT rolls, and +30 on all surgery PT rolls.
Spies get a +30 PT roll bonus when picking pockets, and opening locks.
Pilots and drivers will earn +30 on driving performance tables.

== *47) Translinker* 

// insert table 639

The translinker is a bidirectional neural to machine connector.
The translinker will allow a veterinarian to directly interface with a piece of medical equipment controlling it as an extension of her own mind.
The translinker would allow a vet to integrate herself with a rejuv chamber and make medical decisions along the way.
The translinker allows her to visualize the device's data as part of her own memory structure, and to control the device's controls as part of her own motor system.
She becomes at one with whatever she translinks with.

A translinker could also be used by a mercenary to fire a piece of artillery, or by a spie to bypass a security lock, or by a mechanic to drive a space vehicle.
A translinker would allow virtual access to a computer's memory system.
If the persona starts to use the translinker for things other than simple machines (robots or AI computers) there is a very real risk of the machine gathering some control over the persona, or the persona becoming addicted to the sensations translinking.

The bonus for employing a piece of equipment with a translinker is +50 on any PT rolls that involve the device.
For example a veterinarian using rejuv chamber through a translinker would be a formidable physician to say the least.
If the translinker is used with a device that does not have data or computer no bonus can be given.
For example a gun would not have any bonuses but a scope attached to gun might.
The to hit bonus would be +250 for smart guns or scopes.


The translinker can take on any format that the referee wishes.
One the persona's end it could require a socket in the skull, or it may simply fold like tin foil over the persona's head.
The connector could be a cord, radio link, or a keyboard deck.
The device could have a plug or a nail that is driven into the side of the machine.

== Vet Equipment Attribute Explanations

=== Combining Equipment

As veterinarians gather medical equipment their proficiency as healers will increase greatly.
In fact with enough medical equipment a low level veterinarian could perform the most amazing of miracles.
Because of this some referees will want to limit the amount of equipment that he persona will be able to use at once.
This is entirely the preference of the referee.
A vet could be limited to using 2 pieces of medical equipment per experience level.
If additional pieces are desired then the persona must make a successful PT roll to include them.
Research teams can greatly assist her because each persona can control several artifacts yet all the players rolling will earn PT roll bonuses.

=== Duration 

Duration is the amount of use that can be had from a piece of medical equipment before it must be discarded, or its batteries replaced.
If the duration only has a certain number of uses like One use, or 50 uses, then the device is depleted when that number of uses is reached.
Many devices only require a freshly charged set of batteries, but other devices are disposable, or require replacement materials.
Devices that have a time length like 500 units, or 25 hours
can operate for that length of time before their batteries are depleted.
If a duration lists a wate like 500kgs This means that the device can process 500 kg of flesh, or materials, before the batteries must be replaced.
The last duration type is power source.
This means that ate artifact requires so much power that it must be attached  to an industrial power source, like a nuclear generator, or a hydroelectric power plant.
It is not uncommon for these artifacts to require a cooling down period, or even a maintenance, between uses.

=== Wate 

The wate of medical equipment is the functional wate of the toy excluding batteries.
For some equipment the wate after tech level adjustment is an indicator of how difficult the machine is to use.

=== EXPS 

The experience point value is awarded to the persona who correctly identifies the device, or is successfully treated with the artifact and then identifies it.
Enormous experience point awards are supposed to be granted to entire expeditions, or research teams, not individual personas.

=== Value 

This is the electrum piece value of the device in a regular market, certain devices may be invaluable if a wealthy enough persona's health is on the line.
