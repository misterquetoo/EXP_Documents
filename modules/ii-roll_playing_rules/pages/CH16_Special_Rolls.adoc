= All Those Rolls

// rework this to HIGH ROLL WINS approach 
// includes rewrite of CF check for bots.

EXP is replete with a collection of rolls.
They all are rationalized to "embrace the high roll"

Targeted Rolls the player is trying to roll higher than a fixed number to benefit their persona.
Attack Rolls, Performance Rolls.

Challenge Rolls the player is trying to roll higher than a dynamic number to benefit their persona.
Saving Rolls, Attribute Challenge Rolls, Sphincter Dice.

Generative Rolls the player rolls dice to see what happens. 
May or may not benefit the persona.
Attributes generation, Mutation Types, TOYs, biomes, skills.

Roll Checks the player or referee roll to see if something particular happens. 
Sometimes built into another die roll.
May or may not benefit the persona.
Critical Checks. Malfunction Checks. Otto Checks. Vehicle Accessories

There are all kinds of rolls in EXP.
It can be a dice heavy game if you so choose.
The most common rolls made are to hit rolls.
The success of a to hit roll is determined in http://expgame.com/?page_id=298[Chapter 27: Tactical Combat].
These are not special rolls.
Any time a persona is trying to complete some kind of class maneuver the player refers to the appropriate performance roll for her persona's class (see http://expgame.com/?page_id=269[Chapter: 14 Performance Rolls]).
These are not special rolls.
This chapter is for rolls that are important but do not warrant a chapter of their own.
This includes rolls that are pitted against a specific persona's attribute, or saves versus poison attacks, or whether a robot loses control of itself, or any roll that does not fit anywhere.

== Damage System Shock Roll (DSS)

The DSS roll, or Damage System Shock roll is a special attribute roll which all anthropomorphic personas must make whenever they lose more than half their current HPS at once.
Even if a persona has only 2 HPS left and loses one of them, she must make a DSS roll;
a persona with 3 HPS , however, could lose one HPS with impunity.
The unfortunate persona must calculate three times her new HPs total, and add her CON to the product;
she must then roll equal to or less than this number on 1d100, or fall unconscious.
Thus, for instance, a persona with 18 HPs left after the blow, and a CON of 9, would need to roll under (3 x 18) + 9 = 63 on 1d100 to avoid being stunned.
Only anthropomorphic personas need worry about the DSS roll;
robots and aliens never fall unconscious.
If a persona loses all her HPS in one attack, she also does not need to worry about a DSS roll, as she automatically falls unconscious and is dying.

*Damage System Shock (DSS) = (HPS Total times 3) plus Constitution *

== Recovery Roll

The REC (or Recovery) roll, is the antidote to a failed damage system shock roll.
A stunned persona must repeat it until she finally succeeds, at which point her weakened body reawakens.
Although both are on deci-dice, the REC roll is somewhat easier than the DSS roll;
instead of needing less than thrice her HPS plusher CoN, a persona may roll as high as five times her HPS plus her CON.
If the persona above described above (18 HPS Total and a CON of 9) needed to make a recovery roll, the player would need to roll under (5 x 18) + 9 = 99 on 1d100.
She will probably do this on her first try.
Table 3.1: Constitution & Recovery ++++++gives a persona's recovery time, the length of time she must languish between attempts at the REC roll.
A persona with a CON of 22 would be able to try the roll every 4 units until she succeeded, while a persona whose CON is only 4 must wait 16 units between each attempt.

*Recovery Roll (REC) = (HPS Total times 5) plus Constitution *

== Control Factor Roll

Whenever a robot persona performs a task for which it was originally designed -- a janitorial bot cleaning up, a combat bot killing an opponent --it must roll below its control factor or briefly return to it's original programming.
Control Factor rolls are usually Normal Attribute rolls  (1d20).
If the janitorial bot were ordered to clean up a room by a charismatic mechanic from the robot's base family, a tough (1d50) Control Factor roll would be need to be made.

The Control Factor of a robot is the robot's INT plus its experience level, and represents how well it has learned to bypass its programming.
To fail a Control Factor roll is to give in to that programming, a persona robot phenomenon known as loss of control.
A robot that has lost control becomes a helpless automaton, a temporary referee person.
 The persona will continue to perform exactly its programmed function without deviation until it regains control of itself.
If the failure occurs during combat, it will last a random number of units determined by the same, die the robot lost control with so failing a tough (d50) CF roll would result in d50 units of boring, non-sentient behaviour.
Outside of combat, the failure will last a random number of minutes on the same die: failing an improbable (d100) roll might lead to over an hour and a half of tedium.

*Control Factor (CF) = Intelligence plus EXPS Level*

A good example is of a persona searching a hardware store for a size L8 wing nut.
Wing nuts are kept behind the counter, so she asks the storekeeper if any are in stock.
Hell,
replies the referee, I don't know: Let's check the sphincter dice.
The player and the referee both roll, but the player's roll is a 94, so the part is automatically available.
She purchases it and leaves.
A  little later, the persona accidentally steps underneath a powerful electromagnet.
The referee isn't sure if the wing nut will be attracted to the magnet or not, so she calls on the sphincter dice once more.
This time, the player rolls a 75, but the referee rolls an 84;
the electromagnet immediately tries to wrest the wing nut from the persona's grip.
The rest of the encounter would be determined by attribute rolls, mutations, or even combat.

== Critical Rolls

Critical rolls are extreme rolls of the dice -- 001 or 000 on kilo-dice, 1 or 20 on a d20, 00 or 01 on deci-dice.
As any amateur statistician will point out, such extreme rolls are no more likely than any other roll, an impressive 998 is no more significant than an obscure 452 
but somehow an air of urgency always accompanies them.
Players inevitably react hysterically to a roll of 000, because there is something so dramatically fateful about it.

In gaming terms, critical rolls represent incredibly fluky results that could be either detrimental or beneficial to the persona attempting them.
Critical rolls add spice to the game, because they always bring that slight chance of the unexpected.
The wimpy little alien stuck in the crevasse might yet beat the arrogant invader in powered armour if she makes a critical to hit roll.
The landlubber mechanic may never have seen an exatmo drive before, but could still manage to patch one together if she makes a critical performance roll.
EXP is science fantasy, and part of fantasy is the unexpected.

Nevertheless, a well-developed scenario should never be terminated early by a critical roll --they exist to enliven, not to destroy, the campaign.
Like all rules, they should serve the players, not the other way around;
any time a critical roll interferes, the referee should simply manipulate the outcome until everything fits once more.

All critical rolls must be natural.
If a player rolls 794 to hit, then no matter what bonuses she has, her roll is not a critical one.
Conversely, if she rolls a natural 01 on a performance roll, all the bonuses in the universe won't keep her from suffering a critical failure.

=== Performance Table Rolls
PT rolls are made on deci-dice;
the goal is to roll high.
A natural 00 will thus bring automatic success in whatever procedure was being attempted, however difficult, and a natural 01 automatic failure.
Some procedures should never have a chance of success -- gall bladder surgery with a meat hook will always result in tragedy --but there's little point in even rolling for these.
Use your common sense.

Occasionally, a critical PT roll success will seem to indicate an exorbitant number of EXPS for the persona.
EXPS are handed out for class skills because of the knowledge gained through the successful maneuver.
A vet who has managed to accomplish something far beyond her skill by sheer luck has gained nothing from the experience but a healthy llama.The referee should reduce her EXPS award accordingly.

=== Attribute Rolls
Critical attribute rolls are redundant.
Since the object of an attribute roll is to roll low, a critical success is a roll of 1 --but since all living personas have positive attributes, only dead personas would ever fail on a roll of 1.
And dead personas don't make attribute rolls.
Conversely, a critical failure is a maximal roll on whichever die is being used -- 10 on d10, 20 on d20, etc.
A maximum roll should fail regardless. Otherwise the persona had no chance of failing, and the referee shouldn't have called for an attribute roll in the first place.

=== To Hit  Rolls
To hit rolls are made on kilo-dice (1d1000), and like PT rolls, the goal is to roll high.
Any roll naturally greater than or equal to 990 is thus called a critical hit, and will inflict from 1-4 (d4) times the rolled damage, a factor known as the damage multiplier.
A natural roll of 000, aka 1000 on a d1000, provides an instant kill.
When calculating the damage from a critical hit, a player first rolls the damage as normal, then multiplies by the damage multiplier, and only then adds her PSTR damage adjustment.

All of this only applies to cases where 990, or 000, would have hit anyway.
If a critical hit is the only way for the persona to hit her target a critical hit simply means a hit, with damage meted out as normal.
Similarly, critical hits by the referee are always just hits, with no instant kills and no damage multiplier, for personas are attacked so much more often than their opponents are that any other ruling would kill off personas far too quickly.

A critical miss with a type A or B weapon is any to hit roll less than or equal to 010;
any player who makes such a roll has dropped, misthrown, misstrung, or otherwise mishandled her weapon.
If the player rolls below 050 with a type C weapon, the referee should check for a malfunctions.
A roll of 001 with a type A weapon indicates that the persona has accidentally damaged herself or broken the weapon.
Any type B weapon attacking with a 001 to hit also automatically breaks, but without damage to the persona;
type C weapons subject to a 001 critical miss automatically jam.
The amount of damage suffered by a malfunctioning weapon can be determined in http://expgame.com/?page_id=286[Chapter 21, Equipment Damage].

=== No Critical Rolls Here
There are no critical rolls in DSS rolls, REC rolls, CF rolls, saving throws, attribute challenge rolls, or sphincter dice.
The first four cases all govern involuntary reactions, in which the body (or mind) is already doing the best it can;
the concepts of critical success and failure are meaningless for white blood cells.
Critical attribute challenge rolls, like critical attribute rolls, are a redundant concept -- if only one persona has a critical success, she's won anyway;
if two do, they're still tied.
Sphincter dice, meanwhile, already have critical rolls built in: if the player rolls over 90, events proceed in her favour, and if she rolls under 10, they don't.
