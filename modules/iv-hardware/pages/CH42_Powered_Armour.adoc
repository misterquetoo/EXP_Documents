= Powered Armour

// must create base explanation of AR, R, Wate etc. 

Powered armour is servo aided and computer enhanced body armour.
Typical powered armour is sealed, carries its own power plant is integrated with it's accessories.
Powered armour enhances the wearer's attributes by electronically amplifying the persona's natural abilities.
The persona wearing powered armour is neurally wired into the suit giving immediate access to an array of equipment built into her armour.

== Powered Armour Base

[horizontal]
Armour Rating:: 750
Restrictiveness:: 15
Wate:: 300% (210kg)
EXPS:: 1000
Value:: 10000000 + accessories

== Restrictiveness
When the exoskeleton is  powered up the armour functions with a restrictiveness of 1.
Unpowered the restrictiveness of the powered armour is 15 and the persona is trapped in a shapely coffin.

== Suiting Up, Suiting Down, Fitting In 

Powered armour is a big deal: any persona or referee persona wearing it becomes a lethal robo-human killing machine.
Since the armour is fully integrated with the persona's nervous system there are some complexities related about how one gets into and out of the powered armour.
The armour may be patiently waiting for someone to step into its half assembled form, ready to activate or it may required dangerous neurosurgical intervention.
An artifact of this kind of influence could easily become the focus of a few scenarios and maybe even a campaign.

Leaving powered armour is at the very least a difficult task.
If there is no automatic release, the persona is faced with shedding several hundred kilograms of metal, removing direct neural links, and dealing with a body atrophied by the use of powered servos.
Suits of powered armour will often have emergency releases where the persona can explode the armour off of her body.
This usually destroys the armour, but frees the persona from her personalized tank.
The referee should remember that psychological obstacles may prevent the persona from shedding her armoured exterior.

Powered armour should fit into the referee's campaign.
The armour may be patiently waiting for someone to step into its half assembled form, ready to activate or it may required dangerous neurosurgical intervention.
The armour may be installed by an institutional medico-military laboratory, like a government or corporation.
The persona may just have always had the armour on, not remembering life without it.

== Aliens and Robots and Mutants 

Oh dear.
A combat robot or a 6 tonne alien suited in powered armour would be a formidable opponent indeed.
If the referee is willing to follow this crazy path then she must keep in mind that a campaign could easily be imbalanced by such a powerful opponent, or ally.

=== Aliens
Alien powered armour would have parts that reflect the number and shape of arms, legs, head and torso of the alien's appearance.
For example an alien with horse legs would have 4 powered armour lower limbs.
Would all of them have accessories like weapons?
Consider a centipede.
If a torso has more than a dorsal and ventral surface the referee may allow for extra rolls for right and left flanks.

=== Robots
The powered armour would be an outer layer of the robot.
All the enhancements that any persona would benefit from would aid the robot as well.
Any peripherals or attacks that the robot has would be able to access the exterior of the powered armour through empty peripheral points.
The robot may shed it's powered armour layer like any other persona.

=== Mutants
Mutations are extremely unlikely to have a powered armour part created for them.
They are different from aliens which can represent an entire species.
How to handle this is left to the benevolence of the referee or a Sphincter Dice challenge from http://expgame.com/?page_id=275[Chapter 16: Special Rolls].
For powered armour wearers that have unique appendages like wings, or tails: tails are rolled as a lower limb, wings as upper limbs, and any other extra limbs as extra rolls in their appropriate sections.

== Powered Armour In Combat 

Combat is made more complex by powered armour because one persona now has many options open to her per unit.
A persona can use all her powered armour devices every unit of combat.
This means that she can fire all her weapons, look with her radar, and launch a nuclear missile all in two seconds.
Multi-tasking of weapons only applies to those weapons that are integrated parts of her powered armour.
This includes items added to peripheral points, but does not include guns being used with armour scopes.
The persona cannot fire all her weapons and hope to carry out performance table rolls at the same time.
The powered armour requires the wearer's complete attention.

== Powering Powered Armour 

Since powered armour is expected to be used continuously it will typically have a power supply that will last a very long time.
Usually a suit of powered armour will have power for 3-12 (3d12) months of continuous use.
Powered armour will not suddenly run out of power.
There will be lots of indicators and indications that the suit is running low.
Having personas with powered armour constantly seeking power can be a fun limitation and aspect of any campaign.
The powered armour will have a power plant similar to that of robots.
When the armour is fully powered it The Robot Power Plant Table is listed here for convenience.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Power_Cell_Type.adoc[]

== Powered Armour Checklist

To make the creation of powered armour easier to manage it is best to record all the facts relevant to the armour, and then proceed to the other chapters from which information is needed.
If the powered armour needs three guns, one piece of medical equipment, and one piece of miscellaneous equipment.
It is best to finish the entire suit of powered armour first, and then roll the extra accessories without returning to the powered armour.

. Suit Abilities


=== Attribute Adjustments 
Powered joints amplify the force and speed of regular body movements.
The suit basically adds speed and strength to the persona.
There are other attribute bonuses that can be earned as other special systems are added to the armour.
Note that these increases are only in effect when the powered armour is being worn, and is in working order.

Wearers of powered armour enjoy a PSTR  increase of 4-10 points (2d4+2) and a DEX increase of 1-6 (1d6).
Not only is the sheer physical force of their movements improved, but the speed of their actions also.
The servo aided power, combined with movement enhancements and computer optimization improves physical strength and dexterity.

Accessories can increase other attributes.
The physical strength and dexterity attribute increases are standard

==== Base Physical Strength Adjustment
.PSTR + 4-10 (2d4+2)
****
Powered armour raises the persona's physical strength by plus 4 to 10 points. 
****

==== Base Dexterity Attribute Adjustment
.DEX + 1-6 (1d6)
****
Powered armour raises the persona's dexterity by 1 to 6 points.
****

=== Head
Head accessories are ones built into the helmeted head of the suit of powered armour.
Any guns built into the helmet will fire from there, and communicators will be accessed directly by the persona There are both standard equipment and random accessories that can be fitted into the helmet of the armour.
Every suit of powered armour has the accessories listed under 

.*Head Accessories List*
* One communication
* One visual aid
* 0-3 (1d4-1) Random Accessories

include::ROOT:partial$CH42_Table_Powered_Head_Random_Accessory.adoc[]

Communication:: 
Head communications have a range of 10 kilometers, and can only be used for communication with other radio receivers.
Head communications cannot be used to jam signals or conduct any electronic countermeasures.
Multiple communication systems represent redundancy and extension of range and types of communications.
If this has been rolled as a random accessory jump to xref:iv-hardware:CH48_Misc_Equip.adoc#_communicators[Communicators].

Aerosol::
There will be 1-12 (1d12) aerosol charges sprayable from powered armour's helmet.
To determine the aerosol type jump to xref:iv-hardware:CH43_Aerosols.adoc#_aerosol_type[Aerosols].

Grenade::
There will be 1-6 (1d6) grenades launchable from the head.
Launched grenades attack as type C weapons, with the range 3 times that of a thrown grenade.
To determine the grenade type jump to xref:iv-hardware:CH45_Grenades.adoc#_grenade_type[Grenades].

Gun::  
A pistol is installed, and fires from the powered armour's helmet.
This gun can only be a pistol.
If the gun has ammunition it will have triple the regular magazine capacity. 
Energy weapons have an unlimited power supply from the armour's power plant.
To determine the pistol type jump to xref:iv-hardware:CH46_Guns.adoc#_gun_type[Guns].

Image Intensifier:: 
The image intensifier is an external speaker system that is combined with the special helmet moldings, and computerized actions that enhances the wearer's external image.
A crystal clear synthesized voice, complete with digital overlays, and computerized body language all aid in producing a special image.
This special powered armour feature is often found in suits of armour used by commanders.
This system benefits the persona's CHA attribute by increasing it 1-6 points.

==== Image Intensifier Charisma Bonus
.CHA + 1-6 (1d6)
****
Image intensifier increases the persona's charisma by 1 to 6 points.
****

Medical System:: 
The helmet medical system is  a medical computer which prioritizes the head for blood supply, and protects the neck with special servos.
This medical system will increase the wearer's constitution by 1-3 points.
The increase in CON does not allow for more HPS to be rolled, but will increase the chance of the persona surviving constitution related saving rolls.

==== Medical System Constitution Bonus
.CON + 1-3 (1d3)
****
Each helmet medical system increases the persona's constitution by 1 to 3 points.
****

Miscellaneous Equipment::  
Any piece of miscellaneous equipment that has a wate less than 10 kg can be installed into the suit's helmet.
The player keeps rolling on the table until a device less than 10 kg is generated.
To determine the light piece of miscellaneous equipment jump to xref:iv-hardware:CH48_Misc_Equip.adoc#_miscellaneous_equipment_type[Miscellaneous Equipment].


Scope:: 
The helmet has an integrated computer scope.
If the powered armour helmet has a pistol installed the scope will be dedicated to that weapon.
To determine the type of scope jump over to xref:iv-hardware:CH48_Misc_Equip.adoc#_scopes[Scopes].

Visual Aid:: 
Vizauds (visual auditory enhancers) are only found in powered armour.
These devices enhance hearing, sight, touch and sense of smell.
Multiple vizauds and systems represent redundancy and further increases in awareness.
Each vizaud that the powered armour has installed will increase the persona's AWE by 1-3 points.
If this vizaud has been generated as a random accessory jump to xref:iv-hardware:CH48_Misc_Equip.adoc#_visual_aids[Visual Aids]

==== Visual Aid Awareness Bonus
.AWE + 1-3 (1d3)
****
Each helmet vizaud increases the persona's awareness by 1 to 3 points.
****

=== Upper Limbs 
Upper limb accessories can be located on the hand, arm or shoulder.
The player can decide the exact location of an accessory.
Each upper limb has 1-3 (1d3) peripheral points where accessories can be mounted. 
Not all peripheral points are occupied during powered armour generation.

Consider a suit of powered armour has 3 peripheral points total on her armour arms.
She rolls 21, 16, and 86 on a 1d100.
There are two rolls less than 30 so she would roll twice on Upper Limb Accessory Table.
The last peripheral point would remain empty for some later attachment.
Most referees will allow a persona to have at least one roll on the Upper Limb Accessory Table.

Personas with more than two functioning limbs may get extra peripheral points per powered armour limb.
This comes into play for aliens that have multiple Type A (thrusting and striking attacks) or mutated personas with additional functioning limbs.

.*Limb Accessory List*
* 1-3 peripheral points per limb
* 30% chance of random accessory per peripheral point

include::ROOT:partial$CH42_Table_Powered_Upper_Limb_Random_Accessory.adoc[]

Communication::
Multiple communication systems represent redundancy and extension of range and types of communications.
If this communicator has been generated as a random accessory jump to xref:iv-hardware:CH48_Misc_Equip.adoc#_communicators[Communicators].

Detector::
These instruments may have read-outs on the arm, or inside the helmet.
Multiple detectors will increase range and offer redundancy.
Generate the random detector by jumping to xref:iv-hardware:CH48_Misc_Equip.adoc#_detectors[Detectors].

Aerosol::
There will be 1-12 (1d12) aerosol charges sprayable from powered armour's limb.
To determine the aerosol type jump to xref:iv-hardware:CH43_Aerosols.adoc#_aerosol_type[Aerosols].

Grenade::
There will be 1-6 (1d6) grenades launchable from the limb.
Launched grenades attack as type C weapons, with the range 5 times that of a thrown grenade.
To determine the grenade type jump to xref:iv-hardware:CH45_Grenades.adoc#_grenade_type[Grenades].

Gun::  
A gun is installed, and fires from the powered armour's limb.
If the gun has ammunition it will have five times the regular magazine capacity. 
Energy weapons have an unlimited power supply from the armour's power plant.
To determine the pistol type jump to xref:iv-hardware:CH46_Guns.adoc#_gun_type[Guns].

Miscellaneous Equipment:: Any bizarre device could be rolled in xref:iv-hardware:CH48_Misc_Equip.adoc#_miscellaneous_equipment_type[Miscellaneous Equipment].
The maximum wate of the artifact is limited to 25 kg, and the mood of the referee.
If the device is not reusable, or it has a wate greater than 25 kg, the player should roll another piece of miscellaneous equipment.
While hilarious, a single use fire log, would not be an appropriate limb accessory.

Peripheral Point::
This allows for an extra piece of equipment to be installed in the upper limb.
For instance a mercenary could have her favorite gun inserted into her powered armour via one of the arm peripheral points.
An arm peripheral point is not a pocket, and nothing can be stored within it.
The wate of the equipment inserted cannot exceed 25 kilograms.
There is a 42% chance a bonus peripheral point will already be filled with an accessory.
This would indicate an additional roll on the Upper Limb Random Accessory Table.

Veterinarian Equipment:: 
Veterinarian equipment is rolled in xref:iv-hardware:CH47_Medical.adoc#_veterinary_equipment_type[Vet Equipment].
The only requirement is that the device rolled be reusable (not a disposable vedi-kit), and it must have a wate less than 25 kg.

Visual Aid:: 
Vizauds (visual auditory enhancers) are only found in powered armour.
These devices enhance hearing, sight, touch and sense of smell.
Multiple vizauds and systems represent redundancy and further increases in awareness.
A vizaud affixed to the hand would allow the wearer to look around corners.

Each vizaud that the powered armour has installed will increase the persona's AWE by 1-3 points.
If this vizaud has been generated as a random accessory jump to xref:iv-hardware:CH48_Misc_Equip.adoc#_visual_aids[Visual Aids]

==== Visual Aid Awareness Bonus
.AWE + 1-3 (1d3)
****
Each helmet vizaud increases the persona's awareness by 1 to 3 points.
****

=== Torso Accessories 

Torso accessories are built into the main body of the armour.
If a computer were built into the torso the wearer would access it via a keyboard in the chest.
There are standard accessories for the torso, and these are included on both the ventral (front) and dorsal (back) aspects of the armour.
Apart from the standard accessories are random accessories.
There is a 15% chance that the armour will have a random accessory built into the torso.
There is one random accessory per roll less than 15.
For example rolls of 04, 11, and 29 would indicate 2 random accessories on ventral surface, and the player would then roll for the dorsal surface.
If a torso has more than a dorsal and ventral surface the referee may allow for extra rolls for right and left flanks.
Aliens can have powered armour too.


// insert table 394

*1) Artillery*:This mechano-trooper has an artillery piece built into the torso of her powered armour.
The weapon will have an ammo supply equivalent to the base gun's magazine size.
No suit of powered armour can support more than one artillery piece, regardless of the number of fronts, backs and flanks the powered armour has.
The only exception to this is if the artillery piece rolled is non-lethal.
If lethal artillery is rolled again the player should make another roll on Table 42-1.3: Torso Random Accessories+++<i>+++.
+++</i>+++To determine the artillery piece refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=333[C]http://expgame.com/?page_id=333[hapter 43: Artillery].

*2) Bomb*: Only one bomb can be built into the torso of the powered armour.
If a bomb is rolled again the player should make another roll on Table 42-1.3: Torso Random Accessories.
The bomb will be delivered via a non-descript all-environments functioning, missile with a range of 20 kilometers away.
If there is no missile to launch the bomb, it has been installed as a self-destruct device, or installed for suicide operations.
To determine the bomb type refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=335[Chapter 44: Bombs].

*3) Communication*:The communication type located in the torso can be quite comprehensive.
The range of this communicator is 50 kilometers, or even off planet (ship to troop).
A torso communicator has 2 to 12 channels and will have the capacity to jam as many signals as it has channels.
A deci die roll is made for the communicator to determine if one of the channels is specialized.
If the roll is less than 20% computer/robot data can be transmitted, if the roll is less than 10% there will be a lazer communicator that cannot be picked up unless it is physically intercepted.

*4) Computer Equipment*:This computer equipment is not linked to the powered armour, and is accessed through some sort of instrumentation on the powered armour where the uppers limbs can activate it.
Most likely this will be the ventral surface.
To determine the computer type refer to the computer section in http://expgame.com/?page_id=343[C]http://expgame.com/?page_id=343[hapter 48: Miscellaneous Equipment].

*5) Computer System*: The computer system is a specialized piece of powered armour equipment.
The computer system extends the persona's intelligence and is completely integrated with the wearer.
The armour's computer system takes personal memory inputs from the persona, and stores them directly into a cybernetic memory link system.
The powered armour computer system also collates all the armour's subsystems into an icon-driven heads up display in the helmet.
The computer system will increase the persona's INT by 1-3 points.
Computer systems can be located both ventrally and dorsally.
Adjustments to the INT attribute will have no effect on the persona's MSTR.
A computer system represents a level of persona and powered armour integration that will make it very unlikely that the persona will ever voluntarily exit her suit.


*6) Gun*: The gun type is determined in http://expgame.com/?page_id=339[Chapter]http://expgame.com/?page_id=339[46: Guns].
The gun will always be a rifle if the option exists for that particular weapon.
It will have ten times the regular ammunition storage, and energy weapons may be powered directly by the powered armour.

*7) Medical Equipment*:This is an actual piece of medical equipment rolled in http://expgame.com/?page_id=341[Chapter 47: Medical Equipment].
The artifact should have multiple uses, for instance a single use vedi-kit attachment would be useless, and should be rerolled.
The attachment is designed for external use only, and cannot be used on the wearer of the powered armour.
This accessory cannot exceed 100 kg in wate.

*8) Medical System*:The head medical system is not a specific piece of medical equipment, but a medical computer which prioritizes the head for blood supplies, and protects the neck with special servos.
This medical system will increase the wearer's CON by 1-4 points.
The increase in CON does not allow for more HPS to be rolled, but will increase the chance of the persona surviving poisoning and staying conscious during combat.

*9) Miscellaneous Equipment*: Any piece of miscellaneous equipment that has a wate less than 10 kg can be installed into the suit's helmet.
Roll in http://expgame.com/?page_id=343[C]http://expgame.com/?page_id=343[hapter 48: Miscellaneous Equipment].

*10) Peripheral Point*:This allows for an extra piece of equipment to be installed in the torso.
For instance a mercenary could have her favorite entertainment system inserted into her powered armour via a peripheral points.
A torso peripheral point is not a pocket, and nothing can be stored within it.
The wate of the equipment inserted cannot exceed 50 kilograms.
There is a 15 % chance a peripheral point will already be filled with an accessory.
This would indicate an additional roll on Table 42-1.3: Torso Random Accessories.

*11) Storage*:This is an internally locked storage compartment.
The capacity of the compartment is equivalent to twice the persona's in-armour wate allowance.
Anything stored in the storage compartment will not be considered part of wate allowance.

[.s1]*12) Visual Aid*:Vizauds (visual auditory enhancers) are only found in powered armour.
These devices enhance hearing, sight, touch and sense of smell.
Each vizaud that the powered armour has installed will increase the persona's AWE by 1-3 points.
A dorsally located vizaud could allow the wearer to look backwards.

== 4) Lower Limb Accessories 

Lower limb accessories can be located on the thigh, calf or foot.
Location of the accessory can be determined by the player or the referee.
The lower limb has standard accessories and a series of random accessories.
These are generated for both the right and left legs.
Any additional functional lower limbs may be powered as well.
Discretion is allowed when assigning lower limb accessories to alien powered armour (consider a centipede).
Each time that the player rolls less than 25% on deci dice there is another roll on Table 42-1.4: Lower Limb Random Accessory.

// insert table 395

*1) Detector*:Rolled on the detector list found in http://expgame.com/?page_id=343[C]http://expgame.com/?page_id=343[hapter 48: Miscellaneous Equipment].
These instruments may have convenient read-outs on the upper limb, or inside the helmet.

*2) Grenade/Aerosol*: Refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=337[Chapter 45: ]http://expgame.com/?page_id=337[Grenades and Aerosols] to determine what type of grenade, or aerosol, is built into the lower limb.
There will be 16 grenades launchable from the knee.
Launched grenades attack as type C weapons, with the range 5 times that of a thrown grenade.
Aerosols contained within the lower limb will have 25 charges, and spray directly from a digit.
More information about grenade/aerosol combat can be found in http://expgame.com/?page_id=304[Chapter 30: Grenade and Aerosol Combat].

*3) Gun*: Any gun type can be installed, and fired automatically from the powered armour's lower limb.
The gun type is determined from http://expgame.com/?page_id=339[Chapter]http://expgame.com/?page_id=339[46: Guns].
If the gun has ammunition it will  have 5 times the regular magazine capacity, and energy weapons may be given an unlimited power supply from the armour's power plant.

*4) Motorized*: This lower limb accessory allows the suit of powered armour to move at great speed by diverting resources to the lower limbs.
The persona can only recline and drive when the motorized movement is activated.
A suit of powered armour can only have one motorized movement system installed.
Motorized movement allows the exoskeleton to run away at triple her movement rate, and not less than 15 hexes per unit.

*5) Peripheral Point*:This allows for an extra piece of equipment to be installed in the lower limb.
For instance a nothing could have her favorite money counter installed into her powered armour via a peripheral point.
A peripheral point is not a pocket, and nothing can be stored within it.
The wate of the equipment inserted cannot exceed 25 kilograms.
There is a 25 % chance a peripheral point will already be filled with an accessory.
This would indicate an additional roll on Table 42-1.4: Lower Limb Random Accessory.

*6) Scope*:The lower limb now contains a computerized scope fully integrated into the helmet.
If the suit of powered armour has a weapon installed in the lower limb, the scope will automatically work with that weapon.
Otherwise the scope is randomly rolled the list of  scopes found in http://expgame.com/?page_id=343[C]http://expgame.com/?page_id=343[hapter 48: Miscellaneous Equipment].

*7) Storage*:This is an internally locked storage compartment.
The capacity of the compartment is equivalent to half the persona's in-armour wate allowance.
Anything stored in the storage compartment will not be considered part of wate allowance.

[.s1]*8) Visual Aid*:Vizauds (visual auditory enhancers) are only found in powered armour.
These devices enhance hearing, sight, touch and sense of smell.
Each vizaud that the powered armour has installed will increase the persona's AWE by 1-3 points.
A vizaud located on the foot could allow the wearer to look under a table or a car without bending over.

== 5) Suit (Special) Accessories 

Suit accessories are those systems which are part of the whole suit.
Some of these abilities are standard for all armour, and they are listed under Standard Suit Accessories+++<i>+++.
+++</i>+++There are also special suit accessories that are determined on Table 42.10: Special Suit Accessories+++<i>+++.
+++</i>+++These are special properties that are composed of protective coverings, specialized computers, or unique servo mechanisms.
Each suit will have 0 to 3 (d4-1) rolls on Table 42.10: Special Suit Accessories.

// insert table 396

*1) Air Conditioned*:Waltz into lethal mechanized combat within the confines of luxuriously air conditioned powered armour.
The air conditioning is more like life support of a space vehicle than just a comfort tool.
Air Con also keeps the wearer from overheating due to the armour's internal heat generation.
Multiple air conditioning units can be considered a redundant safety measure or the player can roll again on Table 48.10:  Special Suit Accessories.


*2) Alarm*:Not all suits of powered armour have enough vizauds to keep the wearer informed of ambush or sneak attack, especially while sleeping.
The alarm system has an AWE of 30, and a 25 hex radius.
It will alert the wearer to any ambushes that it detects.

*3) Anti-Personnel*:To avoid having extremely expensive suits of powered armour overwhelmed by hordes of suicidal natives, some suits are adorned with nasty anti-personnel devices.
The 2 hex radius of effect blasts everything with an excruciatingly painful dose of electricity, flame, flash, shrapnel, or sound.
Anything holding onto the powered armour must make a save versus mental attack, or let go of the suit.
The anti-personnel system will also inflict 2 to 12 (2d6) hit points of damage to everything within 2 hexes.
The intensity of the painful repulsion attack is equal to the damage inflicted (2-12).
The anit-personnel defence can, be used every other unit of combat.

*4) Compu Cammo*: The most exterior layer of this armour is coated with trillions of optical sensors and multi-coloured emitters.
When in the cammo mode, the sensors are used to inform the light emitters, via an integrating computer, of the most beneficial shade of camouflage.
The light emitters can also be used to change the colour of the armour to reflect the mood of the wearer.
The suit allows the persona to become obfuscated its surroundings.
A difficult AWE rolls must be won to notice the humanoid tank lurking in the shadows.
This greatly increases the armour wearer's chance of executing a successful ambush.
Once involved in combat the compu cammo is of no use against all but the most terminally unaware.
The compu cammo described above  is primarily visual if the powered armour was fabricated to hide from opponents that primarily used smell or vibration for detection the cammo may reflect olfactory or vibrational camouflage.

*5) Hardened Casing*: This is simply a measure of the toughness of the alloy-ceramic hull that makes up the protective part of the powered armour.
Each time hardened casing is rolled a d100 is added to the powered armour's armour rating.

*6) Hover*:A limited antigrav generator and retractable fins give the armour the capacity to safely coast down from any height.
This may sound trivial, but it is pretty impressive to arrange for a several hundred kilogram lump of metal to glide.
Hover allows for limited control, and the persona can change direction to choose the best landing site.
The persona can use any attack while hovering.

*7) Internal System*: This particular specialty can only be used if the referee permits.
It indicates that the powered armour abilities have been surgically implanted within the persona's body, and she appears no more abnormal than any other anthro in EXP The difference is obvious when lazers leap from her fingers, and grenades launch from her head.
The complexities of this biological reinforcing cannot be shrugged off by the referee as magic, and she must be ready to justify all the physical.
alterations.
Much equipment will be lost on a conversion from an exoskeleton to an internal system.

*8) Jump*:Biomechanical computers combined with limited anti-gray, and super charged leg servos will launch the mutant a distance up to 5 times her armour adjusted PSTR.
The jumps will take 0 to 3 units to complete, covering the desired distance while flying through the air.
During the jump the armour wearer will be able to use all weapons and devices at her disposal.

*9) Preprogrammed*:With preprogramming the suit's servo system is directly linked to the persona's cerebellum which is in turn linked to a series of neural programs.
These neural programs take over the wearer's motor control system, and give her complex mercenary maneuvers as instincts.
In certain situations the preprogrammed armour will have acted against a target before the target's existence has reached the armour wearer's consciousness.

How preprogramming effects the persona in play is difficult-to determine.
Not being ambushable is one benefit.
Operating as a mercenary with +50 on all mercenary PT rolls is another benefit.
For instance jumping through a wall and discharging all weapons at any available target would get the bonus, but if she wanted to secure the safety of a particular target she could not use her preprogramming.
There is also a 1% chance during situations of surprise that combat programming may take over.
For example an elevator door opening suddenly or a someone yelling boo!li

*10) Radar*:Radar allows for long range (250 hex radius) sweeps that can identify ground terrain and large bodies in motion.
Standing within 2 hexes of active radar is a 1 to 6 intensity radiation attack.

*11) Radiation*:Special dense packed waveform absorbing coatings double the wearer's CON vs killing radiation, also ensuring that the personas CON vs radiation cannot be less than 16.
If the persona saves, the radiation has no effect.
If the suit is radiation hardened more than once or twice, the wearer's CON will be tripled, and quadrupled against radiation attacks.

*12) Sealed*: Immunity from the effects of all non-combat environmental conditions.
