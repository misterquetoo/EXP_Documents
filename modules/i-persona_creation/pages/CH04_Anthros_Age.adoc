= Anthro Age

Used to calculate the starting age of the persona in years.
Ages vary wildly from anthro type to anthro type. 
Most of the anthro ages fall into the young adult category.
In the case of an ursidae the player would roll 1d4 and add 8.
This generates an age between 9 and 12 in years.
The age is recorded on the persona record sheet.
