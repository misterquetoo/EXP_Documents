The dexterity attribute represents many abilities which are collectively referred to as DEX.
Agility, balance, eye-hand coordination, reflexes and running speed are but a few components of dexterity.
A character with a high dexterity could move faster, change direction better and have quicker reflexes than a persona with a lower DEX.
A player may be required to make a DEX attribute roll when her persona attempts to catch a priceless vase or tries to dive through a closing door.

A persona’s dexterity also directly affects her amour rating.
Amour rating determines how difficult a target is to hit during combat.
So a player character with a high dexterity can dodge and deflect attacks better and, consequently, has a better amour rating.

A persona’s movement rate is determined by her DEX.
Table 3.2 is used to find how fast a persona can move in h/u (equal to m/s).
So a player character with an 11 DEX could move 4 h/u.
This means her figure can be moved 4 spaces (hexes) in one play (unit).
For a more detailed account of movement, refer to Chapter 12.
Time and Movement.

The dexterity attribute is rolled on 3d6 and this makes its range from 3 to 18.
If a persona’s dexterity should happen to fall below 1, she is irrevocably dead due to complete motor-nervous system failure.
