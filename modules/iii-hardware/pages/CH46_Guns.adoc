Value:: 2000

An aerosol pistol amplifies range and efficiencies of aerosols.
The aerosol pistol doubles the range, and triples the number of charges.
The pistol does not alter area of effect, duration, or damage of an aerosol.
Aerosol canisters cannot be disconnected from the pistol until all charges are extinguished.
An aerosol with a 10h range and 3h area of effect would have a 20h range.
There would be no change to the area of effect.
The aerosol could be used 3 times instead of the usual single use.

A malfunction indicates a loss of all remaining charges.
There is a slim chance (determined by the ref) of the weapon exploding on malfunction.

=== Antimat Pistol

[horizontal]
Weapon Type:: C
Range:: 90h (-100)
Accuracy:: -30
Damage:: Special
Magazine:: 1 + Batteries
Wate:: 2.7kg (5gm)
EXPS:: 900
Value:: 100000 (10000)

An antimat pistol launches a micro particle of antimatter suspended in a lattice of electrons.
This lattice will shatter when it hits a liquid or solid.
The resulting explosion will instantly annihilate 50 kg of matter.
The explosion releases a blast of heavy particles and super-heated gases that will affect everything within a ten hex radius regardless of cover.
Everything in the ten hex radius will take 25 to 70 (5d10+20) hit points of damage.

A malfunction with this weapon means the electron lattice has shattered within the gun.
This usually means a harmless misfire, but if the ref is in a bad mood the gun will disintegrate itself.

=== Antimat Rifle 

[horizontal]
Weapon Type:: C
Range:: 150h (-95)
Accuracy:: 0
Damage:: Special
Magazine:: 2 + Batteries
Wate:: 5kg (10gm)
EXPS:: 900
Value:: 375000 (15000)

An antimat rifle also launches a micro particle of antimatter suspended in a lattice of electrons.
This lattice will shatter when it hits a liquid or solid.
The resulting explosion will instantly annihilate 100 kg of matter.
The explosion releases a blast of heavy particles and super-heated gases that will affect everything within a 25h radius regardless of cover.
Everything in the 25h radius will take 25-70 (5d10+20) hit points of damage.

A malfunction with this weapon means the electron lattice has shattered within the gun.
This usually means a harmless misfire, but if the ref is in a bad mood the gun will disintegrate itself.

[horizontal]
Weapon Type:: C
Range:: 150h (-100)
Accuracy:: 0
Damage:: Death
Magazine:: 1
Wate:: 2kg (200gm)
EXPS:: 500
Value:: 250000 (30000)

The beegun's activation chamber excites a normally docile insect into a poisonous rage.
After two units of warming up, the beegun is ready to fire as a normal weapon.
If this weapon scores a hit, the insect will inject a deadly and instantaneous poison.
The hit victim must save vs intensity 19 to 24 (18+d6) poison, or die.
If the target does save she will be comatose for 1-4 days.
The ammunition for a beegun is not reusable.

A malfunction can only occur with the ammo of this weapon.
If a malfunction occurs, a hit will inflict 1-10 hit points of damage, but it will not be poisonous.

Range:: 150 (-50)
Accuracy:: +75
Damage:: 4-48, 3-36, *3-30*, 3-24, 2-20
Magazine:: 15
Wate:: 3.7 kg, *3.4 kg*, 3.1 kg (1.5%)
EXPS:: 400
Value:: 500 (1)

This is your familiar terran hunting, or target, rifle.
This weapon can also be called a pump action, revolving chamber, steam, or pneumo-rifle.
The medium powered bolt action rifle damage is 3-30 and its wate is 3.4kg.

A malfunction with this weapon is a ammo misfire, and not a jam.

=== Cryogun 

[horizontal]
Weapon Type:: C
Range:: 15h (-1000)
Accuracy:: 0
Damage:: 4-24 (4d6)
Magazine:: 10 per Battery
Wate:: 2kg + Battery
EXPS:: 700
Value:: 6000

A cryogun precipitously drops the temperature creating ice, snow and death.
A hit with the cryogun will both inflict damage and freeze the target in place.

There is also an area of effect attack for all targets along the path of the cold blast.
Every target within the 15h x 2h blast will take damage.
Damage is rolled once for the entire attack
There is also a chance that targets will get frozen in place.
The chance of being entrapped is 1% per hit point of damage.
With 15 hit points there is a 15% chance of trapping a medium sized in ice.
There would also be a 15% chance of freezing swords in scabbards, buttons in the on position, steering wheels straight ahead, etc.
The chance of freezing must be checked for each target.

The freezing effects of a cryogun will melt away in 6 to 60 units.
Heating will halve the melting time.

This weapon is also known as a Frigid Aire, or a cop gun (they don't have to yell "freeze" they just pull the trigger).

A malfunction results in the loss of a charge.

=== Death Ray 
[horizontal]
Weapon Type:: C
Range:: 40 (-99)
Accuracy:: -125
Damage:: 2-16 (2d8)

The death ray inflicts 2-16 (2d8) hit points of damage plus a good chance of death.
Any target hit by the death ray must save versus intensity 3-24 (3d8) poison or die.
The intensity of the killing attack is generated every time the weapon is fired.

This weapon is also called a kill-o-zap gun or a terminator.

The malfunction of this weapon will occasionally call for an attack on the firer.
Normal malfunctions result in the loss of all remaining charges.

=== Derringer 

[horizontal]
Weapon Type:: C
Range:: 40h (-99)
Accuracy:: -125
Damage:: 2-16 (2d8)
Magazine:: 5
Wate:: 1.25 (1.5%)

=== Disintegration Gun 

[horizontal]
Weapon Type:: C
Range:: 100h (-115)
Accuracy:: 0
Damage:: 8-64 (8d8); Special
Magazine:: 5
Wate:: 4.5kg + Batteries
EXPS:: 20
Value:: 500 000 + Batteries

The disintegration gun turns solids into elemental particles. 
The nicely organized matter turns into a cloud of dust.
This weapon is very temperamental and outcomes vary each time the trigger is pulled.
Like all good disintegration weapons it is capable of making a target disappear.
The cascade of disintegration only begins if a hit is scored on a target.
A miss will not result in a disintegration cascade.
Every target hit will take the assigned 8-64 (8d8) hit points in damage.
If the disintegration cascade starts much more damage follows.

.*Disintegration Cascade*
Each attack has a chance of disintegrating it's target. 
The disintegration cascade will affect 1-100 (1d100) kgs of wate.
The amount of disintegrated matter is unique each time.
The greater the amount of matter affected the greater the chance the cascade will fail.
There is a 1% chance per kg of matter that the attack will fail.

So an attack that is affecting 42 kgs of a target has a 42 percent chance of failing.
Basically the player immediately rolls the 1d100 again. 
If the second roll is greater than the amount of wate things disintegrate.
Using the above example of a 42 kg cascade the player immediately rolls again.
If the roll is 42 or higher the cascade is successful and 42 kgs disappears.
If the roll is 41 or lower the cascade fails and the weapon inflicts 8-64 hit points.

.*Disintegration Damage*
If the target has a wate less than the amount of matter disintegrated it disappears.
If it is a persona she is irrevocably destroyed and suffers classic disintegration.
Partial disintegration inflicts 1-20 (1d20) hit points in damage per kg destroyed.
For example, a 100 kg target that has 21 kg disintegrated will take 8-64 plus 20-400.
Very few personas survive a disintegration event.

Pistol version.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

.*Other Stuff*
The disintegrated matter must be semi-contiguous.
For example, a hit on the backpack, would annihilate the backpack, and send its contents clattering to the floor.
If hit location is important jump to xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH36_Hit_Locations.adoc[Hit Location].
If there is trouble deciding if matter is contiguous or not jump to xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH16_Special_Rolls_Asshole.adoc[Sphincter Dice]

WARNING: Nomenclature overlap could lead to different methods of disintegration. User must be remain wary.

A weapon malfunction indicates an internal disintegration event.
This will most likely destroy the weapon.
This gun is also known as a vaporizer, a duster and a dismodulator.

The grapple gun fires a sticking device attached to a strong cord.
The grapple is the mainstay of most every action movie in existence. 
This weapon offers great opportunities for story progression.

There are two type of grapple guns. 
Destructive and non-destructive.
The player can pick either. 
Otherwise there is a 42% chance the grappled will be destructive.

Both grapples are mechanized and can lift 130kg straight up at 3 h/u.
An unattached grapple can be power rewound in 1 unit of combat time.
An attached grapple can only be removed if there is *no* cord tension.

Grapple guns have a off label use of being used to hit and pull in unwilling targets.
There is no rule set for land fishing.
A recommended approach would be to first compare wates.
If wates are comparable (medium sized vs medium sized) then move to physical strength challenges. 
To compare personas competing by attribute jump to xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH16_Special_Rolls_Attributes.adoc#_attribute_competition[Attribute Competition].

The sticky grapple can only be removed by pushing a button on the gun.


=== Gravruptor Gun 

[horizontal]
Weapon Type:: C
Range:: 30h (-80)
Accuracy:: 0
Damage:: Special
Magazine:: 10 per Battery
Wate:: 4.25kg + Battery
EXPS:: 1000
Value:: 10000 + Battery

The gravruptor gun inflicts gravitational anomalies to disrupt and damage.
A hit by the gravruptor subjects the target to a blast of random gravity.
A miss has no effect on the target or surrounding objects.
The gravruptor is ineffective against target's with a wate greater than 500kg.

Most often the gravruptor gun will add 1-4 (1d4) gravities to the local terrain.
The target may crash to the ground, and weapons are torn from grasps.
This pressing problem will also inflict damage to all targets in the area of effect.
This damage is 1 to 12 (1d12) hit points in damage per extra gravity.
E.g., 3 gravities would smash targets into the ground for 3-36 hit points of damage.

Being crushed into the ground, flung into a ceiling or wall, or shot into space the damage is the same.
It is possible that further damage may follow if the persona flies off a cliff, or lands in a toxic waste pit.

include::ROOT:partial$CH46_Table_Gravruptor_Effects.adoc[]

All of the above effects are described for a normal gravity world.
What effects this gun has on high gravity and low gravity planets depends entirely on the ref.

The gravruptor gun is designed for zero gravity combat.
It has no recoil to cause the firer any spin problems, and sends those targets that it hits flying off into space.
A successful to hit roll will still inflict damage for accelerating the target, and the target will then fly away at 1 h/u per 2 hit points of damage.
Thus a hit that inflicts 20 hit points of damage would send the target racing off into space at an uncontrolled movement rate of 10 h/u.

The gravruptor gun is also known as an accelerator rifle, or a gravgun.

A malfunction with this weapon will result in a gravitational anomaly attacking the weapon and weapon holder.

To avoid being stunned to player must roll versus 3-24 (3d8) intensity poison.
The target takes no damage but will remain stunned for 1-3 (1d3) minutes.
 
Inorganic personas are not stunned, but can be damaged by this weapon.
Robot personas take 1 hit point of damage per intensity.

Other names for a stun pistol is stunner, pacifier or slumper.
A malfunction with this weapon results in the loss of a charge.

== Gun Attribute Explanations

=== Weapon Type 
Type refers to the weapon type that the gun falls into.
The separation of these weapon types is detailed in http://expgame.com/?page_id=300[Chapter 28: Weapons].
A type C weapon can make one attack per unit.
This means one to hit roll every 2 seconds.
The delay between attacks is due to items like weapon recharge, weapon re-stabilization, re-aiming, or recalibration.

When using the combat table, as in tactical combat, all weapons in this chapter attack as weapon type C.
This is the classification for powered weapons.
All guns attack as weapon type C regardless of whether their type is listed as type D, type E, type F, or Flotto.

==== Attack Types 
Guns that recharge faster, are better stabilized, or are easier to aim can fire more often.
For example, type D attacks twice per unit, type E attacks three times each unit, and type F attacks four times a unit.
Often a gun will have several types listed like C, D, F.
This means that the persona can set the weapon to make various numbers of attacks each unit.
This is usually adjusted by trigger squeeze, or some switch setting on the weapon.
Each attack requires a to hit roll.

==== Flotto 
Flotto is a full auto feature where the weapon releases at least 15 rounds in less than 2 seconds.
This full auto burst yields 5 to hit rolls, where the persona can aim at any five contiguous targets in her forward field of vision.
A hit will score 0 to 3 bullets on the target.
Each bullet that hits the target will inflict the damage listed for the gun.
If a gun that inflicts 2-12 HPS of damage, hit with a full auto burst for 2 bullets, the attacker would roll 2d6 twice for damage.
The full auto is a very lethal attack.
However, as the rapid fire mode continues, the gun becomes more and more difficult to control, and a cumulative to hit roll penalty of -30 is added for each successive to hit roll.

The flotto attack can bog down combat for inexperienced players.
The first thing to do if combat is getting slow is to remove the -30 per to hit roll penalty.
If this doesn't work then replace the 5 to hit rolls with a single to hit roll on one target, that inflicts 1 to 11 bullets of damage if it hits.
Deadly, but simple.

=== Range 
The range is the effective range of the weapon itself.
This does not reflect the skills of the persona in anyway.
The weapon's range is limited by wavering bullets, dissipating charges, or decaying material.
If the range is listed as 120 hex, (-230): the gun has no to hit penalties up to 120 hexes, and then a penalty of -230 to hit per hex beyond that range.
This gun would have -230 to hit a target 121 hexes away.
Some weapons even have -1000 for any hexes beyond their range, this means that the attack literally stops at that distance.
Theatrical combat has no range penalties, and any range effects are optional.

=== Accuracy 
Accuracy very simply reflects the accuracy of the gun.
The better balanced, and better designed, the weapon, the easier it is to hit the target.
The accuracy attribute of a gun is simply added to the to hit roll.

=== Damage 
The damage is the range of hit points that can be removed from a target when the gun scores a hit.
The more hit points removed, the more damage the gun inflicts.
The guns are given a range of damage that is randomly generated each time a successful hit is made.
This randomness accounts for all the unpredictability that is involved in tissue damage and projectile physics.
This damage range is all the damage that the gun can inflict;
type C weapons get no damage adjustment.
When using the combat table all powered weapons whether type C, D, E,+++<b>++++++</b>+++F, or Special attack as type C weapons

*Special*: If the gun's damage is listed as "Special", then the nature of the damage is discussed in the gun description, and it is usually complex or has some special effect (vaporization, death, etc.).

=== Calibre
If there is a list of damages like 2-24, 2-20, 3-18, 2-16, and 1-15, then this gun has models with various calibres, or power levels.
The middle damage range (in this case 3-18) is the medium calibre attack and is the standard damage of the weapon type.
A gun with calibres will only have one damage type.
For example, the first damage range on the list inflicts the most damage, 2-24, it is the highest calibre (power level), and is called an extra high powered weapon.
The list goes as follows: XHP, HP, MP, LP, and XLP.
See Table 46.1: Gun Calibre if the referee chooses to randomly determine calibre.

// insert table 529

=== Magazine 

The magazine of a gun is the maximum ammo amount that can be found in the cartridge, or the maximum number of attacks per battery set.
When this number of attacks is exhausted, the persona must reload.
A gun with an ammo listing of 45 could fire 45 rounds before the persona would have to reload.
Referees should note that artifact guns are rarely found fully loaded.

=== Malfunction 

The malfunction stat is the kilodie chance that the weapon has lost its attack for one reason or another.
If the weapon has a malfunction stat of 30, any to hit roll less than 30 would indicate a weapon malfunction.
The lost attack may be due to a dud shell, a battery mischarge, or a mechanism jam.
Some malfunctions have lethal effects for those standing nearby the weapon.
The malfunction is checked against the persona's unadjusted kilodie roll.
The referee should check any unadjusted kilodie roll less than 40.

=== Wate 

The wate is simply the unloaded wate of the gun in kilograms.
The wate of a gun can be reduced, or increased, depending on the tech level of the device.
If a list of three wates is given (4.62, 2.75, 1.95), then they refer to the different wates of caliber weapons.
XHP, and HP use the leftmost value (4.62), MP uses the middle value (2.75), and LP, and XLP use the rightmost value (1.95).

The wate of ammunition is included in brackets beside the gun wate.
If there is no value listed to the right of the gun wate, then the gun uses batteries, and the battery wate is added instead.
A set wate, like 20 gm, gives the wate of a complete cartridge.
A percentage value indicates that the wate of the ammo is a fraction of the wate of the entire gun.
For example, if a 2.5 kg gun had ammo listed as 1% then one of its shells would have a wate of 25 gm.
As a ref, I ignore ammo wate completely.
The information is included for the purists, or for when enormous amounts of ammo are being handled.
Remember only keep the data that makes the game more fun.

=== EXPS 

This is the amount of experience points awarded to the firer of the gun, or whoever else, identifies the gun's nature.

=== Value 

This is the value of the gun, if it should ever be sold, or appraised.
There is no guarantee that a gun will be sold for its correct worth.
The value given that is in brackets indicates the value of the ammo, "b"
means that the ammo is actually a battery charge.
