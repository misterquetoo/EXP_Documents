= Initiative

Initiative is the manner in which the order of play is decided during combat.
Any combat undertaken is likely to dissolve into chaos, and real combat among players, if no turn sequence is adopted.
Every game has some way of deciding the order of play, and combat in EXP is no exception.
What the ref must decide is the level of pseudo realism that is desired for her initiative system.
An initiative system for combat in a role-playing game must decide the order of action for the players and the referees.
These systems can vary from the simple to the complex.
Three levels of initiative are described in this chapter: None, theatrical, and tactical.
They are arranged in order of both complexity and realism.
Sometimes initiative  is shortened  to the contraction init
and it is pronounced in-ish.

== Tactical Initiative

The fog of combat is not well represented by any role playing system.
The limitations of the the theatrical initiative system will become obvious very quickly.
Tactical initiative can become as complex as desired.
Tactical initiative system should be adapted in parts.
The referee needs to have a good handle on the combat system of choice.
Both Theatrical and Tactical Combat systems will work well with tactical initiative.
Players need to understand their weapons, attributes, weapon types, and the nature of movement.
The benefit of this initiative system is its imitation of realism.
Personas with high DEX attributes** **enjoy an advantage over their less dextrous opponents.
Not only does a dexterity advantage give the persona a greater chance of acting first, but they also have the choice to act whenever they want.

=== Initiative Roll
All combatants must make an individual initiative roll on a d20, adding their DEX* *to the result.
The ref will usually make one initiative roll for large homogeneous groups of referee personas.
However a premium referee personas with special skills or mutations could be given their own initiative rolls.
So if a player were to make an initiative roll of 5 with a d20, and her personas DEX* *was 12 her initiative roll would be 17.
Her initiative priority would be higher than those personas with an initiative roll less than 17, and lower than those with an initiative greater than 17.
Once initiative rolls have been generated for all combatants, the order of highest to lowest values must be determined.
This order doesn't designate the order of action, but the order of initiative priority.

=== Tied Initiative Rolls
Any tied initiative rolls  must be resolved with unadjusted d10 rolls: there is no simultaneous combat.
If two initiative rolls this must be resolved.
In the tactical combat system the initiative becomes an order of priority and their cannot be tied priorities.
So if two players both rolled 17 for their initiative rolls.
Each player would roll 1d10 to extend their initiative roll one decimal place.
If the players tied again, for example they both had initiatives of 17.3, then they must roll again.
When which ever player rolls higher gets a higher initiative priority.
Any player that rolled 18 or higher would have a higher priority than the player with 17.37, who would have a higher priority than the player with 17.33, all of whom have a higher priority than the player who rolled 15.

=== Initiative Priority
Higher initiative rolls in the tactical initiative system allows the player to act first if they so desire.
If the player would rather hold back her action until others have acted they may do so.
The order of play starts with the persona that has the highest priority.
This persona may either move or attack immediately, or wait until later in the unit to act.
If the persona opts for the latter it is called waiting
her attack, or waiting
her movement.
The persona can wait her movement, her attack or both.
Waited actions are generally left until the end of the unit, but the waiting persona may intercede at any time and act if she feels it is necessary.

=== Waited Actions
This is the key difference between tactical and theatrical combat: the initiative winners are given highest priority, and are not required to act first.
Often it is beneficial to be able to move after the opposition.
Knowing what your opponent is up to can be very beneficial.
So a higher initiative roll can be used to make the opposition force their hand, as well being able to beat them to the punch.
Hence the concept of highest initiative gets priority, as opposed to moving first.
When a high priority player chooses to intercede, she must make a Normal (1d20) AWE attribute roll before she jump back into the queue.
If she fails the attribute roll, she must wait until after the next in line for action.
There can be some risk when one waits their combat actions.
Any persona, except the one with the lowest priority may wait their action until the end of the unit.
If several personas have waited their actions, they will be forced to act from lowest to highest priority.
All personas must act before the end of the unit unless they have chosen not to act.

== Anatomy of a Unit 
A very simple example of a unit of combat involving four personas is given here.
The four personas are:  Abel, an initiative roll of 26;
Babel, an initiative roll of 21;
Cable, an initiative roll of 13;
and Dabel, with an initiative roll of 9.


// insert table 247

// insert table 248

// insert table 249

// insert table 250

Unit one has ended.
All the players make new initiative rolls for their personas and the process continues, unit per unit until combat has ended.

== Points About Attacks
A persona can only attack if her weapon is ready, loaded, strung, or whatever.
No persona can engage in a non-combat action and be able to attack.
No persona can exceed a weapon types maximum number of attacks per unit regardless of her  initiative roll.
Waited attacks are lost if the persona is killed, knocked unconscious, stunned, or paralyzed.
A persona with a waited attack may attack before another combatant if she successfully makes a Normal (1d20) AWE attribute roll.

If personas with multiple attacks are in a toe to paw fire fight the referee and players may modify the initiative to compare each of the personas attacks.
Some system like this may become desirable if the players feel that it is unfair that a nothing can empty her full automatic lazer rifle before the 6th level mercenary
can use any of her multiple attacks.
However, it is recommended that this be treated as tough luck, and that the mercenary should be treating a persona with such a weapon with respect.
Spie martial artists can precede other personas that have beaten them in initiative.

== Points About Movement
Personas are allowed up to their entire movement rate for the unit.
Moving a fraction of ones movement rate is considered the personas entire movement for the unit.
Personas waiting their.
movement are also subject to attacks form powered, and non-powered missile weapons (weapon types C, and B).
Waited movement is lost if the persona is killed, stunned, knocked down, etc.
A persona with waited movement may move before another combatant if she successfully makes a Normal (1d20) AWE attribute roll.

== Points of Order
The reader may now feel the options and intricacies of the tactical initiative system closing in around playability.
Never fear;
the system can be run smoothly if everyone pays attention to their waited movements, and attacks.
The biggest threat to administering the tactical initiative system is distraction.
A colorful description, or hot local gossip, can send the initiative order into an irretrievable tailspin.
The group must should only use those parts of the tactical initiative system that suits them.

All personas that have ended their unit should shut up, or leave the room.
The tactical initiative system can become quit confusing, and interruptions can become fatal.

=== Referee Personas
The referees personas act the same as any other persona.
For example, persona C could have represented 2 robotic referee personas, and the other 3 could have been expedition personas.Actions are also dependant on the weapon types used by the personas.
Persona A could only attack while moving, with a type C weapon, and no persona can attack with a type A weapon on any target that has waited its movement.

=== Psionics
Generally psionic attacks will precede anything that involves physical action.
A mutant can initiate a defensive or offensive mutation whenever she needs to, regardless of where she is in the initiative list.
If initiative is a competition between psionic attacks or mental mutations initiative can be rolled on a d20 using MSTR as the adjustor.
This would only be be for comparing two mental events.


Ways to avoid complications are: ensure that the lowest priority combatant moves, and attacks as soon as possible;
to not allow personas to split waited attacks and moves (if a persona wants to wait for her opposition to act then she must wait both her attack and movement);
and to have all the referees personas act at once, regardless of their varied DEX attributes*.*

=== Winning Initiative
Winning initiative is not like surprising ones opponent, and there is no element of disguise in ones actions.
If a persona has some action, ability or skill that could precede an attackers action then it should be carried out.
For instance a knite can always deflect projectile attacks, regardless of whether she won initiative or not.
A spies martial arts can precede any type A attack on her.
