. aliens represent entire species
. only tool using aliens use weapons
.. tool using aliens use a vocation combat table for weapons
. naturally evolved attacks only use Bonus Proficient
.. flora and fauna only have BP for natural attacks and nothing else
. only tool using aliens use armour
. naturally evolved armour rating is randomly determined
.. body part types do not affect armour rating
. damage adjustment is included in the alien's damage per attack
.. natural abilities DO NOT get a PSTR damage adjustment
