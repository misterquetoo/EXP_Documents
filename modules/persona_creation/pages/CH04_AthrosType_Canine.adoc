The race of canines can be more scientifically referred to as Homo Canis.
The canines are humanoid dogs that are covered in fur and sport doggy tails.

A canine persona can select the looks of one of many dog types: poodle, terrier, wolf, jackal, dingo, fox, etc.
No matter which of the canine types are chosen, the persona remains a bipedal humanoid that possesses no other natural abilities other than those described here.
For example, real bloodhounds have finely tuned detection senses but the only searching aid a bloodhound persona would receive would be her AWE.

== Radiation Sense

Although not all canines are bloodhounds, they stil have a keen sense of smell.
This keen aromatic faculty allows the persona to — when actively searching — detect radiation.
The canine’s radiation detection range is 2 hexes per point of AWE.
This is a simple yes/no response as to whether radiation is present or not.
The ability to sense radiation yields no more information about the radiation source other than its presence and general direction.

To determine the radiation type, the Homo Canis persona must get closer to the source.
The effective range for determining radiation type is 1 hex per 2 points of AWE.
Once within range, a canine has a 5% chance per point of MSTR of properly identifying the radiation type.
If properly identified, the canine persona will get some idea of its intensity and general type.
Intensity should never be described to the player as numbers.
The referee should describe it as dangerous, background, lethal, etc.
More information about the dangers of radiation poisoning are described in Chapter 19: Special Rolls.
The type of radiation will rarely be of importance to the expedition and, if it is, the referee must be prepared to describe it.
Note that the two abilities are separate; if the canine fails to identify the radiation type, she is just as likely to be poisoned by it as any other persona.
