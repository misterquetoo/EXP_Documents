= Physical Mutations

Mutants with physical mutations are the true mutants.
They are the horned humans, the pink ursidae, or the metal skinned aquarians.
Physical mutations have some connection with the the outside world.
These interfaces between the mutant and the environment can vary from very blatant external organs to very subtle changes in structure.
It is these organic interfaces to the outside world that yields the descriptive quality that most physical mutations have.
Personas with physical mutations physically look different, and even a cursory medical examination will immediately expose a physically mutated persona.

Physical mutations are complex manifestations of tumours gone bizarre, and mutated versions of genes that are not normally expressed.
The physical mutation could arise spontaneously, or could have been congenital (born with it).
The mutations can also be highly sensitive versions of normal physiological structures.

The mutations are unique to the personas that harbors them, and they have not been handed down through the generations.
Possibly grandma and grandpa carried a recessive version of the gene, but it took mom and dad to expose their gametes to the proper mutagens.
The mutant herself may have been party to the mutation creation as she may have played too close to mutagens that altered her growing body.

Mutants may have certain personality traits because of their unique nature.
The unique cosmetic challenges they face may make them individualistic, but not psychopathic.
Mutants can be kind caring personas with antennae on their heads, and pincers in their mouths.

== Mutation Type 

The number of mutations that a persona has is determined on the Mutation Frequency Table, in http://expgame.com/?page_id=248[Chapter 7: Mutations].
The number of mutations varies depending on race, desires of the player, and the referee's input.
If the persona is supposed to have 3 physical mutations then the player rolls once on Table 59.1: Physical Mutations at least three times.
The Physical Mutations Table:The Physical Mutations table is used by personas when they are generating new personas.
There is one roll made on this table per physical mutation.
A deci-die roll of 86 would indicate physical mutation 52, Tear Away Body Parts.

include::ROOT:partial$CH59_Table_Physical_Mutations.adoc[]

== Mutation Types


== 1) Acidic Enzymes 

// insert table 887

This mutant has a hyperactive stomach that produces excess amounts of acid and digestive enzymes.
Her stomach is surrounded with extra layers ofmuscle which can contract powerfully and eject a spittle of corrosive acids.
The mutant's esophagus, mouth and lips are covered in thick protective skin, and her teeth will be small and gnarled.
Although her upper digestive tract is protected from the acid the rest of her body is affected normally.

The acid spittle acts aÂ§An offensive weapon.
In the duress of combat she can release one spittle every other unit of combat.
The spittles can be cast up to 1 hex per point of adjusted PSTR+++<b>+++, +++</b>+++attacking as a type B weapon.
If the mutant should score a hit the spittle will inflict 2 to 16 (2d8) hit points of damage plus one hit point per experience level.
Thus a 3rd level mutant with a 12 PSTR could spit acid 15 hexes, and inflict 5 to 19 hit points of corrosive damage.

Damage from this digestive acid attack permanently damages organic tissues, preventing them from spontaneously regenerating.
The digestive juices will have no effect on inorganic materials.
A food culture will not grow after being bitten into by a creature with this mutation.
The mutant will probably have a penchant for more spicy foods anyway.
Swallowing acidic compounds will not affect the mutant much.
Kissing is out of the question unless her partner also has this mutation.

== 2) Adaptation 

// insert table 888

The thinkspace and immune system of this mutant is extremely flexible and resilient.
It allows her to adapt her body to things such as poisons, mental attacks, and diseases.
If the mutant is subject to such an attack there is a chance that her body will adapt to the attack.
Once adapted to the attack later attacks will be unable to inflict damage.
There is also a chance that the mutant will become permanently adapted to the damage form.

If this mutant were subjected to E.S.P., mental mutation 14, her thinkspace would cloud her thoughts to future invasions.
If a needler loaded with paralyzing needles were to hit the mutant's blood stream her immune system would destroy the toxin, and her body would alter to protect those sites where the toxin acts.
Adaptation could push a bacterial infection out through her skin, or carry it to her stomach for digestion.

Adaptation radically alters the mutant's body chemistry, or thinkspace structure, and cannot be endured for too long.
The temporary adaptation will wear off after the mutant's first sleep.
There is a slim chance of permanent adaptation occurring.


A decidie roll less than twice the mutant's adjusted INT will indicate that the mutant has temporarily adapted to the attack.
She will remain adapted to the damage form until her next sleep.
There is also a 1% chance per experience level that the mutant will become permanently adapted to the attack.
Permanent adaptation means that the mutant can never be affected by the attack again.
The mutant may be permanently adapted to a number of attack forms to one third her Irrr.
Thus a 3rd level mutant with a 12 INT would have a 30% chance of temporary adaptation, and a 3% chance of permanent adaptation.
The mutant can remain permanently adapted to no more than one attack per 6 points of INT.


Adaptation also applies to benevolent effects as well as damaging attack.
For example, quick fixes, healing pharmaceuticals, or benevolent mutations could be adapted to as well.
There is also a chance that the mutant will permanently adapt to an attack or benevolent intervention.
So if  the mutant above with a 12 INT were permanently adapted to stun attacks, and lazer attacks.
Stun and lazer attacks would have no effect.
However if the persona needed a heal from a medi kit she may develop a permanent adaptation to medi kit cures.
This would knock the oldest adaptation of out her immunologic memory and she would be adapted to Lazer attacks and medi kit heals.


== 3) Attraction Odor 

// insert table 889

The attraction odor is a combination of sexual pheromones, chemotactic agents, food tracking aromas, mental vibrations, and thought patterns.
These factors work together to attract less intelligent referee personas towards the mutant.
The mutation may present itself by having the mutant constantly surrounded by a certain kind of flying insect, or she may notice that whole herds of nomadic aliens change course to follow her.
Most often a singular poor beast is driven to the mutant because the attraction odor simultaneously resembles its favourite food and a mate.

The attraction odor is most effective on creatures of low INT (INT < 7).
Typically drawing them towards the mutant uncontrollably.
When the attracted creature finds the mutant, and the mutant turns out to be neither food nor mate, it will get a save vs poison in an attempt to leave.
The intensity of the poison will be equal to the persona's CHA.
Until the creature saves versus the attraction odor, it will follow the mutant about making strange noises.
Saves are granted each day until the creature loses interest (when it saves).
Most of the attracted aliens will be dangerous since they will certainly find something worth eating, or mating with, amongst the expedition members.
The type of alien attracted by the odor is determined on Table 45.7: Attracted Personas.
Conveniently included below through cut and paste__.__

// insert table 506

The area of effect of this mutation gives an idea of its scale.
It does not mean that all carnivorous fauna within 10 kilometers will charge towards the mutant.
It is expected that many have saved along the way and lost interest.
What the mutation does do is double the chance of alien encounters in general, and each encounter has a 25% chance of being the attracted animal type.
If a repellant is used, the repellant/attraction odor combination will negate each other's effects for the duration of the repellant.

Attraction odor has a generally attractive aroma, and makes more intelligent creatures slightly more benevolent to the mutant.
The mutant's CHA is increased by 1 point, and she receives a bonus +15 when negotiating.

== 4) Arms 

// insert table 890

The mutant is now the proud owner of an extra 1-4 randomly moving arms.
These arms are free willed and infuriating.
They follow semi-spaztic actions of their own volition, scratching the persona's ears, grappling with her nose, shaking each other, making obscene gestures, or reaching out to tentatively grab things.
Binding down the arms is not feasible since the mutant will quickly tire as they strain unceasingly.

Each extra arm has a penalty of -1 on the mutant's DEX attribute.
This penalty is the same regardless of the location of the extra arm.
If the mutant somehow gains mental control over physical state (mental mutation  31) the arms can be controlled the same as normal arms.
Of slight benefit to this mutant is ambidexterity.
She may use both of her hands with equal dexterity since she has no dominant handedness.
Surgical removal of the extra arms will not restore the decreased DEX, and will negate the ambidexterity effect.
Arms does not count as a start up mutation, and the player receives another roll.

// insert table 891+++<figure id="attachment_5360" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5360" style="width: 237px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i1.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cubistmutation.665.png?resize=237%2C183[A change will do you good.,237]](https://i1.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cubistmutation.665.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5360" class="wp-caption-text">+++A change will do you good.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== 5) Body Structure Change 

// insert table 892

This mutant has complete control over the pliable nature of her body.
She can release enzymes that loosen her connective tissues allowing her muscles to pull her body into any conceivable structure that she wishes.
Her arms may be moved to her back or onto her legs.
She could adjust her face by changing the shape of her nose, pulling her hair back into her head, and restructuring her skull.
She could retract all her arms and limbs, turning into a ball shaped thing.
She could restructure her internal organs to assist a veterinarian in surgery.
She has complete control over the shape of her muscles, bones, and internal organs with this powerful mutation.

The mutant cannot alter her wate, remove any amount of flesh voluntarily, alter her thinkspace, or radically change her skin or hair colour.
There is also a 1% chance per hour (cumulative) that the mutant will not be able to return to her original form.
Thus a mutant that had her arm on her head for 4 hours while trying to reach a banana will have a 4% chance of permanently having her arm sticking out of her head.

There is a 2-8 unit (2d4) transformation period where the mutant's body is particularly malleable.
This is usually a disgusting sight where the mutant is transforming and manipulating her body.
If any damage is incurred during this time, it will be tripled.
The mutant can retain the shape for one hour per point of adjusted MSTR.
At the end of this time her body will return to its previous structure.
The restructuring will also have a 2-8 unit period of susceptible malleability..

== 6) Carapace 

// insert table 893

The carapace is a horrendous buildup of thick semi-pliable skin.
The carapace will usually be a reddish brown colour, but the mutation could present in other shades.
The carapace is a protective covering that reduces the damage received from kinetic attacks, and makes the mutant more difficult to damage in general.
The carapaces vary in the amount of body that they cover.
Refer to Table 59.7: Carapace Covering to determine the amount of body covered, and the effects of  the coverage.

A partial carapace has an armour rating adjustment of +99.
So an unarmoured mutant with a partial carapace would have a base AR of 599.
If armour is found that can be fitted over the partial carapace its armour rating will be increased by +99.
Any kinetic damage delivered to the mutant would be reduced to 3/4 (25% reduction).
Thus attacks from type A weapons, falls, bullets would have their damage reduced, but lazers, electron rifles, explosions, fires, and acids would be unaffected.

If the player wishes she can have her persona tend to her partial carapace, helping it grow as she increases in experience levels.
If she does this she must remember what her initial die roll was, and then add 10 to it for each new level of experience.
If the player had rolled 42 on the decidie she would start with a partial carapace.
At 2nd level her roll would be increased by 10 to 52, at 3rd level her partial carapace would have grown into a total carapace (62), and her CHA and DEX would decrease by 1 point each.
At 6th level the mutant's carapace would have grown to mondo sized (92), and all the AR and attribute changes that go with it.
As the carapace grows from level to another the attribute penalties increase by one point.


// insert table 894

== 7) Chameleon Power 

// insert table 895

The mutant's skin is composed of microscopic light detectors, each of which is intimately linked with chromocytes.
These two specialized skin cells cause the mutant to automatically blend into her surrounding environment.
Any time during day or night this mutated being's skin will attempt to conceal itself.
This can be useful while hiding, or while being a nuisance.
The mutant's skin will unconsciously carry out this reflex, and the only way it can be prevented is by wearing clothing.
Even then the skin will adapt to the colours of the inside of the clothes.

When naked this mutant can be very difficult to see.
Unless a persona is actively searching for this mutant she will have to make a difficult (d20) AWE roll to notice her.
If the mutant is actively hiding this increases to an improbable (d100) AWE roll.
If the mutant is involved in combat she will be revealed with an easy (d10) AWE roll.
This ability is useless once she is detected, or under the direct eye of a persona.
The persona is still subject to detection by lights, sonar, infravision, etc.


== 8) Decoy 

// insert table 896

The decoy is a detachable tail like appendage which can be dropped from the body at will.
It appears as a lump of flesh sticking out of the mutant's hindquarters.
The decoy proves most useful when evading pursuit.
The tail can be dropped at any time, and without any time loss (unless armour must be removed).
The decoy releases an attracting aroma, that is 80% effective with creatures with lower intelligence (INT < 7).
It is only effective on more intelligent creatures if they fail a save versus poison.
The intensity of the poison is equal to the CHA of the mutant.

The aroma has a radius of effect of 1 hex per level of experience.
Those that are affected by the aroma will become insatiably hungry and will devour the decoy madly.
If several personas are vying for the palatable decoy it is not unlikely that fights will ensue over the morsel.

Inside the decoy there is an ingestive killing poison.
The poison has an intensity level equal to half the mutant's CON+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++For more information about the effects of poisons, consult http://expgame.com/?page_id=275[Chapter 16: Special Rolls].
Once the decoy is devoured the attracting effect will wear off, and the decoy diners will have to recover from the effects of poison.

The decoy is regenerable, and will grow back after one night's sleep.
Any damage inflicted to the decoy while it is attached is applicable to the mutant,.
The decoy can withstand 10% of the mutant's hit points in damage before dropping off involuntarily.
If this occurs regeneration will take as twice as long.
The decoy has a wate equal to 3% of the mutant's body wate.

== 9) Density Control 

// insert table 897

The mutant can equilibrate the density of her body to those of surfaces that she is in contact with.
This is done by internal bladders that fill with gases, liquids, or bodily solids.
These natural materials are instantly mixed to the density that will attain equivalence with the surface that she is standing on.
There is no change in shape or size of the mutant.

The mutant can make the density of her body equal to that of liquids, pressure pads, or gases allowing her to cross them without sinking down.
She could also increase her density to that of a solid surface, making her very difficult to displace or damage.
Once this equilibrium is reached the mutant may move about freely upon the surface unless heat, cold or acidic properties can damage her.
The mutant cannot decrease her density if she is more than http://expgame.com/?page_id=279[encumbered].

If the mutant were to make herself more dense would reduce damage taken by 1/4.
Thus any damage taken while she is denser is multiplied .75.
A denser mutant can have the effect of doubling her PSTR when resisting movement.
The mutant cannot inflict higher amounts of damage, or increase her chances to hit with increased density.

When the mutant is less dense she can reduce the damage from type A and concussion attacks.
This is done by having herself fly out of the way, as her less dense body converts damage into kinetic energy.
She will land 1 to 6 hexes away, reducing her damage by 10% to 60%.
So being knocked back 3 hexes would reduce her damage by 30%.
As the mutant's density has been adjusted she does not take falling damage from being knocked around.
This mutant could also decrease her fall damage by 60% by changing her density during a fall.

This mutation maybe employed (a new density can be achieved) once a day per three points of adjusted CON+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++Each new density can be maintained for 1 minute (30 units) per point of adjusted MSTR**.**

== 10) Diminished Sense 

// insert table 898

Table 59.8: Diminished Sense will determine which sense is decreased in effectiveness.
Diminished senses are serious disabilities that the player will be frequently challenged with.
Effective gaming with a diminished sense defect should be rewarded with large amounts of experience points.
The defects are difficult to role-play around, and the referee must be constantly aware of them.
Cures, or replacement parts for the persona should be one of a priority of one of the referee's earlier scenarios.
This mutation is a defect and does not count as a start up mutation.
The player receives another roll on the Physical Mutation Table.

// insert table 900

*1) Sixth Sense*:The most common of the lost senses involves the mutant's thinkspace.
Diminished sixth sense represents a clouding of the mutant's thinkspace making it unable to properly interface with the persona's consciousness.
If this sense is lost the mutant is stripped of all her mental mutations.
Since her interface between consciousness and the psionic realm is damaged many mental mutations cannot affect the mutant.
Those mental attacks that attack via the thinkspace will have no effect.
E.S.P., Mental Control, Hostility Field, and Sociability Field are just some examples.
Mutations that manipulate the environment around the mutant will have normal effect.
This includes mutations like Time Stop, and Molecular Disruption.
Attribute penalties are -1 to AWE and -2 to MSTR**.**

*2) Smell/Taste*:The loss of this sense forfeits the use of any aromatic detection devices.
The mutant is unable to detect noxious poisons, or other smelly surprises.
This mutant is unaffected by nausea gases, or attraction odors of any sort.
There are also penalties of -1 on AWE, -2 on saves vs gaseous poisons, and half AWE** **to detect ambushes.
This defect does not conflict with the canine ability to detect radiation.

*3) Hearing*:The persona is plain deaf.
There is a 90% chance of understanding sign language.
Sign language can be taught to one new expedition member every month of game time.
There is a penalty of -2 on AWE** **as long as the persona is deaf.
Sonic attacks will inflict 1/2 damage.

*4) Touch*:This unique defect has left the persona with a severely diminished sense of touch.
This is purely tactile, and the mutant's ability to walk is unaffected.
Other than the DEX penalty of -2, sense of touch is probably the most beneficial sense to lose.
The mutant has no sense of touch, and therefore a diminished sense of pain.
Damage that involves physical pain, which is most damage, is reduced by one half.

*5) Sight*:If sight is the lost sense movement will be assisted by a natural sonar ability.
The sonar will allow the mutant to move around, but she is still unable to see.
AWE attribute rolls must be made to be able to differentiate between expedition sonar blips, and opponent sonar blips.
As long as the mutant is blind, she will suffer penalties of -2 on DEX+++<b>+++, +++</b>+++and -4 on AWE+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++Activities that require other senses will be enhanced by a bonus of +25.
If blindness should be cured, the attribute penalties will be dropped, but the rudimentary sonar will remain.


== 11) Double Physical Pain 

// insert table 899

The mutant has little or no threshold for pain, and her pain receptors are hypersensitive.
Any pain based damage is increased by 2-8 (2d8) hit points.
Those pharmaceuticals that relieve pain last half as long for this mutant, and she will constantly be on the prowl for painkillers that will alleviate some new ache.
Note that this mutant greatly resembles a hypochondriac.
Damage is also healed twice as fast by this mutant, since she is hyper-attentive to her healing process.
For more information on healing see http://expgame.com/?page_id=267[Chapter 13: Health].
This mutation is a defect and does not count as initial mutation.
The player receives another roll on the Physical Mutation Table.

== 12) Edible Tissue 

// insert table 901

On this mutant's chest is a 4 cm thick buildup of nutritious and tasty regenerating flesh.
The flesh is muscle like, slightly denatured, and stocked with vitamins, fats, glycogen and other essential nutrients.
The mutant simply tears off strips from her chest and eats them throughout the day.
This can supply one day's food for the mutant (it cannot be eaten by any persona other than the mutant).
The edible tissue requires exposure to sunlight and air.
This helps it absorb water, and generate essential vitamins.
If the tissue is hampered by some covering production will drop to 1/2 a day's rations.
If the fleshy substance is not debrided (torn off) daily, it will die, smell bad, fall off, and not grow back for a week.
Note that water still must be consumed by the mutant.

== 13) Electric Shock 

// insert table 902

There are a series of organs found in this mutant's torso which generate and store a powerful electric current.
This stored electric charge can be conducted down the mutant's limbs and delivered to an opponent.
The mutant can either touch her target, or arc the current through air like a lightning bolt.
A shocking ability indeed.

Making direct physical contact results in dangerous high amperage current traveling though the target.
If the mutant chooses to touch her victim the shock will deliver 7-16 (d10+6) HPS of damage plus 1 hit point per experience level.
The to hit roll is made as a type C attack.
Conductive armour will yield a bonus to hit of +100.

When using the ranged attack a crackling arc of blue light jumps toward the target.
If a successful to hit roll is made the bolt will inflict 3-12 (3d4) hit points of damage plus 1 hit point per experience level.
A to hit roll is made as a type C weapon.
A bolt may be tossed up to 1 hex per 2 points of adjusted PSTR.
Thus a 4th level mutant with a 10 PSTR could launch a lightning bolt 7 hexes, and inflict 7 to 16 hit points of damage.

Both the ranged and the contact electric shock attacks are type C attacks because they require no physical effort to inflict damage.
The current generating organs need time to recharge themselves, limiting this attack to every second unit.
The current generating organs can also partially absorb electric shock attacks directed at the mutant.
Any electric shock attacks are reduced to 1/3 damage on this mutant.

== 14)  Enthalpy Attack. 

// insert table 903

Enthalpy attack is possible because of the mutant's modified brine like blood.
The mutant's heart constantly pumps the blood at a ferocious pace to vessels near the surface of the mutant's skin.
This keeps the anti-freeze like blood absorbing heat from the air.
Consequently every persona within 2 hexes of the mutant will be kept comfortably cool in temperatures up to 50 degrees celsius.

The mutant can also unleash a blast of freezing cold air combined with flying icicles and breath whipped snow.
This freezing attack will inflict 2 to 16 (2d8) HPS of damage, plus one hit point per level of experience.
The range of this attack is 1 hex per point of adjusted PSTR.
It takes a while for the mutant's bellows like lungs to recool, and the breath attack can only be used once every 3 units.
The mutant takes double damage from cold based attacks, but heat based attacks will inflict half damage.

== 15) Fat Cell Accumulation 

// insert table 904

This mutation causes an increase in the number and size of fat cells in a specific location on the body (it's not a malignant tumour).
The blob of fat will always be harmless, noticeable, and embarrassing.
If surgically removed it will aggressively grow back in one to four (1-4) days.
The growth will have a CHA penalty of minus 0 to 3 (d4-1) points, but no other penalties can apply.
I.e., if the fat cell accumulation is on the persona's face they would not suffer any AWE penalty or to hit roll penalty.
To determine the location of fat cell accumulation use Table 59.9: Fat Cell Accumulation.
Most polite referees will allow the persona another mutation roll if this is a startup mutation.
This is called being nice.

// insert table 905

== 16) Gas Generation 

// insert table 906

This mutant can release a noxious spume of gas from her mouth, or some other orifice.
The type of gas released is determined on Table 59.10: Gas Generation.
The mutant is impervious to attacks from her generated gas type, and receives +2 on all saving throws versus gas.
The intensity of the poison (gas) is equal to half the persona's CON, plus one intensity point per level.
Thus a 3rd level mutant with a 14 CON would exhale intensity 10 poison gas.

The mutant may release varying amounts of gas, but wind conditions must be considered when exactness is desired.
The rest of the expedition is not immune to the mutant's poison gas.
Under certain conditions, maybe extreme duress or after the consumption of certain foods, gases may be released without control.
For more information about the effects of poison gases consult http://expgame.com/?page_id=275[Chapter]http://expgame.com/?page_id=275[16: Special Rolls].

// insert table 907

*1) Death*:A highly toxic green cloud of death is released by this mutant.
The maximum area of effect is a 5 hex by 5 hex patch.
All organic personas within the area of effect must save versus a poison attack.
Those who do not save will take damage from the attack, which is a 1d4 hit points in damage per point of poison intensity.
Those personas which do save will reduce damage by half.
The lethal cloud will dissipate into uselessness in 0-3 units.
The Combat Ratio is doubled by this mutation.

*2) Nausea*:This gas effects all organic creatures that inhale the nausea gas.
Each persona must make a save versus poison each unit that they remain within the cloud.
Those that save will be unaffected by the gas.
Those that fail the saving throw will be incapacitated with nausea.
They will be unable to act for 1 to 8 minutes (30 units).
The maximum area of effect of this attack is a 3 hex radius around the mutant.
The duration of the gas cloud's cohesion is 2-8 units.

*3) Paralysis*:The paralysis gas leaves its affected targets unable to move any of their voluntary muscles for 3 to 30 (3d10) units.
A save must be made by anyone that enters the 3 hex by 3 hex fog.
This patch of foggy gas will break up in 1 to 8 units.

*4) Pharmaceutical Effect*:The pharmaceutical type that the mutant can belch up is generated in http://expgame.com/?page_id=347[C]http://expgame.com/?page_id=347[hapter 50: Pharmaceuticals].
The pharmaceutical type can be generated once when the persona is generated, or every time the mutation is employed.

Since pharmaceuticals are so variable in their effect the referee must be prepared to alter the mutation according to each pharmaceutical.
For instance, a narcotic drug should have an area of effect, and the mutant should be immune to it.
However, a powerful healing drug would have only one dose, and the mutant would be able to use it herself.
The frequency of the mutation's use may be altered depending on the pharmaceutical's value.
The time it takes to synthesize a new dose of the pharmaceutical could be one day for every 1000 eps of value.

*5) Unconsciousness*:This hazy orange gas causes instantaneous unconsciousness for those organic creatures who do not save vs poison within the 3 hex radius.
Targets will remain unconscious until awakened.
In a normal combat setting this would be 0 to 3 units.
Otherwise they will lay dormant for days.
A save versus poison must be made for every unit of exposure to the gas.
The gas's intensity is higher than normal, being equal to the persona's CON, plus one intensity point per experience level.
The gas is lighter than water but heavier than air, and dissipates swiftly (1-2 units).

== 17) Haste 

// insert table 908

The mutant's nervous system is specially wired with large diameter, low resistance neurons, and a hormonal system that can be flooded with adrenaline.
Haste depends on the sudden surge of adrenaline which allows the mutant to do everything at double speed.
Problems can be thought out in 1/2 the time required (if solvable).
Movement is doubled.
Swings per round and missile fire are doubled.
This mutation can be activated for a length of time in units equal to 1/2 the creature's adjusted CON.
Once begun, haste cannot be halted, and all activity will be engaged in at double time, or not at all.
The effects of pharmaceuticals, will wear off twice as fast (i.e., 1/ 2 their duration), when haste is being employed.
After haste has been used, complete rest for 1 hour is required.

== 18) Heat Generation 

// insert table 909

The mutant is a heat generating machine.
Anything that produces body heat will be operating at a higher than normal pace in this mutant.
Uncoupled chemical reactions will be producing heat, the friction of the cells in her body, as well as whole body thermal conduction will assist in the heating of this mutant.
The referee can check, when ever she sees fit, to see if the mutant has accidentally ignited some nearby flammable artifact.
Check the sphincter dice in http://expgame.com/?page_id=275[Chapter 16: Special Rolls] to determine if something is flammable or not.

Heat generation keeps the mutant nice and toasty warm at all times.
The mutant is unaffected by cold temperatures as low as twenty degrees below zero celsius.
The mutant will also heat up any personas within a hex radius.
This creature's body temperature runs at a minimum of 42Â°C, and is highly susceptible to infravision and fire attacks.
Fire and heat attacks inflict double damage.
In turn this mutation acts as a defense against cold attacks, which do half damage.

During the heat of battle this mutant may launch jets of searing flame from her person, up to the phenomenal distance of 2 hexes per point of adjusted PSTR.
The flame attacks as a type C weapon.
If a hit is scored the target will be subject to 3-18 (3d6) hit points of damage, plus 1 hit point per EXPS level.
The dramatic flame attack can be used every third unit as it takes 2 units to reheat the attack system.


== 19) Heightened Attribute 

// insert table 910

With this mutation an attribute of the mutant will be adjusted to bizarre extremes.
Which of the attributes is affected is determined on Table 59.11: Heightened Attribute, and is described in the following paragraphs.

// insert table 911

*1) Awareness*:The awareness attribute determines how well the mutant's consciousness is interfaced with the environment.
Heightened AWE will indicate larger than normal ears, big bulging eyes, a long nose, an extremely sensitive palate, and a very delicate sense of touch.
The mutant's AWE attribute is permanently increased by 2-8 (2d4) points, and her AWE cannot be less than 15.
She will in addition earn a bonus of +30 on any awareness related PT rolls, and tripled AWE when trying to detect an ambush.

*2) Charisma*:This mutant can turn on the charm in whatever form it is required.
Heightened charisma is not just beauty, but also includes persuasiveness and sociability.
The mutant will automatically adjust her facial structure, hair length and posture to suit what ever goal she wishes to attain.
If she wishes to be alluring, her pupils will dilate, her hair will lengthen, and her voice will change.
If she needs to work up a crowd into a frenzy, her posture will be erect, her face will harden, her hair will shorten, and her voice will deepen.
This mutation offers a permanent CHA bonus of 2 to 8 (2d8) points, and her CHA cannot be less than 15.
She also has a bonus of +30 on any charisma related PT rolls, and tripled CHA during negotiation rolls.

*3) Constitution*:The mutant has superior versions of all those organs that make up the constitution of the persona.
Her heart is healthy and strong, her blood is resilient, her immune system is ready to go, and she has a  liver that can detoxify anything.
This mutation offers a permanent CON bonus of 2 to 8 (2d8) points, and her CON cannot be less than 15.
There are obvious benefits to this mutant when generating her hit points.
The mutant can re-roll her hit points, using her new CON, but the HPS score cannot decrease.
The increased CON value will assist the persona in making saving throws, and any save that the mutant makes against an toxin will indicate absolutely no effect.
In addition to this the mutant has her recovery duration decreased by half.

*4) Dexterity*:The mutant has additional cerebellar processors located throughout her body which are connected to an extraordinarily high number of proprioceptors.
This allows the mutant to carry out amazing feats of balance, agility and speed.
In the normal course of movement this mutant cannot fall, slip or stagger, and if she should be propelled from a high surface only a d4 per hex is taken for falling damage.
This mutation offers a permanent DEX bonus of 2 to 8 (2d8) points, and her DEX cannot be less than 15.
She will in addition earn a bonus of +30 on any dexterity related PT rolls, and tripled DEX during attribute rolls.

*5) Intelligence*:This mutant's brain is physically different from that of other personas.
Her skull is specially adapted to accommodate the oversized and densely packed grey blob of neurons.
The mutant's head is larger than normal, and has special gills that help cool her overactive brain.
When she concentrates on some cerebral topic her brain may actually begin to hum from the increased blood flow.
This mutation offers a permanent INT bonus of 2 to 8 (2d8) points, and her INT cannot be less than 15.
She will in addition earn a bonus of +30 on any intelligence related PT rolls, and tripled Iwr during attribute rolls.

*6) Physical Strength*:This mutant not only has more muscles than normal, but those muscles are better ones.
The muscle fibers are larger, and more densely packed with the chemicals that make contraction possible.
This mutation offers a permanent PSTR bonus of 2 to 8 (2d8) points, and her PSTR cannot be less than 15.
In addition she will have a tripled PSTR during attribute rolls.

*7) Hit Points*:This mutant's body is ready for damage.
Her blood congeals faster, and can stem a greater hemorrhage than other personas.
Arteries can seal off, and create alternate blood pathways.
Her bones are stronger, and her muscles can absorb shock better than normal.
In general this mutant will look solid and tough.
The mutant's maximum hit points will be increased by 20% to 80% (2d4 times 10%), and her HPS max cannot be less than 60 hit points.
This mutant will heal twice as fast as other mutants, and can double her HPS* *when making recovery and damage system shock rolls.

== 20) Heightened Vision 

// insert table 912

This mutation gives the mutant a special optical ability.
The heightened vision is in addition to whatever is considered normal vision for the persona.
She may switch from one form to the other as needed.
Heightened vision may just be an extension of the normal vision.
The eyes of this mutant should be visibly different from those of her anthro type.
Each heightened vision is discussed in the paragraphs following Table 59.12: Heightened Vision__.__

// insert table 913

*1) Infravision*:This allows the mutant to discern thermal irregularities in objects and the environment.
Infravision essentially acts as night vision.
The range of this vision is equal to the mutant's summed MSTR* *and AWE+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++If the mutant already has infravision, her infravision range will be extended by that amount.

*2) Microscopic*:This vision enhancement allows the mutant to adjust the shape of special lenses within her eyes.
She can magnify the view of items under her nose up to 1000 times.
This improvers her PT roll by 25 when working with procedures that benefit from microscopy or inspections.

*3) Mist Cutting*:This mutant's optical center can filter out the effects of any obscuring particulate matter suspended in the air.
This includes, smoke, fog, dust, hail, or severe rain.
This means that the mutant will be able to see through smoke screens, and will not be affected by meteorological conditions.

*4) Semicircular*:This mutant's eyes are very fish like, overly large, and bulge out of her head.
These eyes allow her a semicircular view of her surroundings.
This gives the mutant a +2 on her AWE, and makes it impossible to flank her in combat.
The mutant's AWE* *is doubled when making an attempt to detect an ambush.
Any procedure that involves a wide scope of view, like watching for mines during space vehicle combat would benefit from this mutation.

*5) Telescopic*:The mutant can clearly read any material up to 10 hexes per point of adjusted AWE+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++Her eyes stick out of her head like tubes, and retract with sucking noises as they scan for the correct focus.
The mutant receives an AWE* *bonus of +1.
Any attempts to hit with type C weapons are afforded a plus 150 bonus for long range sniping attacks.

*6) Ultravision*:The mutant's eyes glow red, and are receptive to the ultra-high frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum.
This mutation gives the mutant equal night/day vision, the ability to sense radiation, and the ability to visualize electronic circuitry as a live and flowing pattern.
Ultravision allows the mutant a bonus of +15 on electronic related PT rolls.

*7) X-Ray*:This is classic see through the walls vision.
The only problem is that the mutant's eyes are radioactive, and expose everything looked into to an intensity 1 radiation attack.
X-ray vision allows the mutant to see through 1 hex worth of sold material.
The mutant is familiar with this view of the world, and can recognize her fellow expedition members as collections of radio-opaque bone formations.

== 21) Increased Metabolism 

// insert table 914

The metabolism of this mutant operates at a rate 3 times greater than the normal for her anthro type.
All of her bodily functions are running at 3 times the normal rate.
This mutation requires an intake of 3 times more food than normal, just to keep from starving to death.
The mutant will always appear emaciated, no matter how much she eats.
For example 3 food cultures would have to be consumed by the mutant each day instead of the regular 1.
This mutation is a defect, and does not count as a start up mutation.
The player should get another roll on the Physical Mutations Table.

== 22) Launchable Quills 

// insert table 915

On this mutant's chest there are 2-12 tightly packed quills.
These can be elevated into a horizontal position, and launched by pressurized methane gas.
Initially all quills must be launched at once.
For each level of experience an additional quill may be held back per attack.
These missile weapons have a range of 1 hex per point of adjusted PSTR+++<b>+++, +++</b>+++and do 1-8 points of damage.
Treat each quill as a type B weapon attack.
One quill will grow back after each 8 hours of sleep.
The mutant's armour must be appropriately tailored to use this mutation properly .

There is a 33% chance that 1 to 4 (d4) of the launchable quills will be poisoned.
Launchable poisoned quills are similar launchable quills except that each quill delivers a lethal poison.
The intensity of the poison is equal to the mutant's CON+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++If the target fails her saving throw versus poison then she will take poison damage in addition to the d8 of puncture damage.


== 23) Light Generation 

// insert table 917

This mutant is in a symbiotic relationship with a subdermal light emitting organism.
The mutant's nervous system can release chemicals which excite and depress the colonies of unicellular organisms.
They in turn produce vitamins and hormones essential to the mutant's survival.
This mutant can radiate light in a radius equal to 1/4 her MSTR.
If desired, the mutant can project a beam emitting from her forehead, extending straight ahead for 1 hex per point of adjusted PSTR.
All of this is done by exciting certain subdermal colonies, and depressing others.
Such ambient manipulations of light can be produced as needed

During periods of intense stress, like combat, the mutant can make the light producing colonies strobe violently.
This is the offensive version of light generation.
The mutant attacks by strobing a flash of light into the sensors of an opponent.
The bolt stems from the orbits of the mutant's own eyes, and is focused by her lenses.
The flash attack has a range of 1 hex per point of adjusted MSTR.
The flash attack exhausts the organisms, limiting the attacks use.
The flash mutation can be used no more than once a day per 4 points of adjusted CON.

The flash attack inflicts no damage, but a save vs mental attack must be made or temporary blindness will result.
Blind targets cannot fight properly, and suffer extreme combat penalties (see http://expgame.com/?page_id=314[C]http://expgame.com/?page_id=314[hapter 17: Combat Adjustments]).
Blindness will last 1 to 6 minutes (30 units per minute).
If the save is successful the opposing creature's vision will still be impaired.
The blurry vision will last for 2 to 20 (2d10) units . Visually impaired targets suffer from tearing eyes, and light sensitivity, but they can still functions.
Their penalties are -200 on to hit rolls, -200 on armour&8221;
rating, +2DD on vision requiring PT rolls, half attribute on DEX rolls, and other stumbling sorts of problems.
This attack will have the same effect on the mutant if it is projected onto a reflective surface.+++<figure id="attachment_5361" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5361" style="width: 215px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i0.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Refrigererator_man-215x300.png?resize=215%2C300[Cool man.

== 24) Mechanical Insertion 

// insert table 918

Somewhere along the course of this mutant's life she had a piece of inorganic equipment installed into and integrated with her body.
It may have been done surgically, she may have fallen on it, her mother might have swallowed it, or it may defy all logical explanation.
This mutation is hard to prepare since the referee must also generate a random toy to be inserted.
Whatever the artifact turns out to be, it will be completely integrated with the mutant's nervous system.
If she has a video cassette player [ed.
note old video storage system] built into her chest she will be able to control its recording time, rewind, fast forward, scanning, and eject as easily as she could carry out any other bodily function.

The only limit recommended here is that the wate of the artifact not exceed 10% of the mutant's wate.
All other restrictions are determined by the referee.
For instance the referee may feel that a fusion bomb would be an inappropriate mechanical insertion.+++<figure id="attachment_5362" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5362" style="width: 203px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i0.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/mechanicalparts.676-203x300.png?resize=203%2C300[Spring in your step.,203]](https://i0.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/mechanicalparts.676.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5362" class="wp-caption-text">+++Spring in your step.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== 25) Mechanical Prosthesis 

// insert table 919

This mutant is now part machine.
Somewhere along the line one or more of her limbs have been replaced by blatantly defective mechanical devices.
Scraping metal levers and gears are poorly wound into the nerves of the mutant.
A prosthesis is subject to rust, and malfunctions (3% chance of a breakdown when under stress), or complete breakdowns (1% per limb/per month).
Damage taken by a mechanical prosthesis is not subtracted from the mutant's hit point total, but there is a 1/ 10 of a percent chance per hit point of malfunction.
The extent of damage to the prosthesis can be determined in chapter 21, Equipment Damage.
A prosthesis does not change the WATE of a mutant, nor does it affect her attributes, but the mutant should be constantly challenged by the inadequacies of the limb.

// insert table 920

== 26) Mitosis 

// insert table 921

This mutation allows the mutant to replace her undifferentiated regenerative cells at any injury site.
This allows her to replace lost tissues, organs, or limbs.
This mutation is not mitosis in the sense of whole organism reproduction, but in the sense of tissue regeneration.
This mutation does not heal lost hit points, although it can prevent some prolonged damage attacks.

This mutation will automatically replace any lost body part that is below the neck provided that the mutant is not dead.
A detached limb will start to bud back within 1 to 8 minutes, and extra damage that may be expected from a lost limb will not occur.
Remember that this mutation will not heal hit points, just arrest their loss.
The limb reproduction will be complete in 2-16 hours.
During the healing period, no movement is allowed.
If movement occurs, the regeneration will take 1-6 hours longer.
If a wound is cauterized mitosis will be unable to regenerate the lost body part.
Once grown back the new limb will function as normal.
The beneficial abilities of this mutation do not stop at limb, and organ replacement.
Any form of secondary damage, like protracted poisoning, acid burning, or post dose radiation damage will be countered by mitosis.

== 27) Multiple Body Parts 

// insert table 922

This genetic phenomenon will be either beneficial, or bad, for the mutant.
Some of the extra body parts are under neural control of the mutant, while others are nothing but malformed cosmetic reproductions of the part.
The player rolls once on Table 59.14: Multiple Body Parts and refers to the following paragraphs for the effects.
If the mutant receives no bonuses from this mutation, it will not count as a start up mutation, and the player can roll on the Physical Mutations Table again.

// insert table 923

*1) Arms*:The mutant will have 1-4 extra arms protruding from her chest.
The arms will always be symmetrically aligned.
The extra arms are fully functional arms that the mutant can use.
This will allow her to use her two right arms to attack twice a unit , but she would only be able to attack with two pairs of right and left arms if she were ambidextrous.
Multiple arms does not indicate ambidexterity.
For those mutants with an odd number of arms (meaning one centered limb) handedness must be determined between left, center and right arms.
+5 is granted on any PT roll that may require extra arms (repairs, surgery, first aid, lock picking).
The extra arm will increase the mutant's CR by one per extra limb.
A PSTR attribute roll maybe given when it involves holding onto things, or multiple DEX rolls may be given when trying to grab things.

*2) Ears*: 1-6 extra ears sprout from this mutant's head.
Half of them will be useless decorations if more than three are rolled.
For every functioning extra ear that the mutant has she will get an attribute bonus of +1 on her AWE+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++There is also a penalty of -2 on CHA if the mutant has an odd number of ears.

*3) Eyes*:1-6 tiny eyes, in addition to her normal eyes, are found on the mutant's forehead half of these eyes will be blind.
The mutant will earn +42 on her to hit rolls, and +1 on AWE for every seeing eye imbedded on her forehead.
The mutant will suffer a CHA penalty of-3 if the total number of eyes is an odd number.
CR increases by +1 per extra seeing eye.

*4) Feet/Toes*:There is a 50% chance that this mutant will have an additional defunct foot on either of her feet, or have 1-3 extra toes on both feet.
If the mutant has more than two feet subtract -10% from any negotiation rolls made.
This mutation variant is a defect and does not count as a start up mutation.
The player should roll again on the Physical Mutations Table, or the Multiple Body Parts Table.

*5) Hands/Fingers*:There is a 50% chance that this mutant will have an extra non-functioning hand, otherwise there will be 1-4 extra fingers on each hand.
This mutant has a negotiation adjustment penalty of-10%.
This mutation variant is a defect and does not count as a start up mutation.
The player should roll again on the Physical Mutations Table, or the Multiple Body Parts Table.

*6) Head*: This diminutive, lifeless, wrinkled head has many of the same neural connections as the mutant's normal head.
So the extra head's facial expressions will mimic those of the mutant.
There is also a chance that the head will betray the real emotions of the mutant.
The extra head cannot be covered up, because it will immediately make gasping and coughing noises with its mouth.
The additional head gives the mutant penalties of-5 on charisma and -30% on negotiation rolls.
This mutation variant is a defect and does not count as a start up mutation.
The player should roll again on the Physical Mutations Table, or the Multiple Body Parts Table.

*7) Legs*:This creature has two to seven extra legs (d6 plus 1).
This will increase the mutant's speed by 20% per extra leg.
Thus a mutant with 5 extra legs would double her movement rate.
CR increases by in crpased movement percentage.
E.g., a movement rate increase of +50% would increase the CR by 1/2.

*8) Mouths*:The mutant has 1 to 3 extra mouths.
These mouths are smaller than the mutant's regular mouth, and they join to it by short oral passages.
The extra mouths can salivate, chew, spit and eject vomit, but they cannot talk.
There is a CHA penalty of-1 per extra mouth.
This mutation variant is a defect and does not count as a start up mutation.
The player should roll again on the Physical Mutations Table, or the Multiple Body Parts Table.

*9) Noses*:The mutant's face is covered with growths of flesh and cartilage that resemble noses.
These specialized outcroppings constantly have a mucous like substance dribbling out of them.
If the mutant should happen to sneeze she is better off covering her whole face with a handkerchief.
This mutation will make the mutant sneeze often.
There will normally be 1 to 8 extra noses with a CHA penalty of -1 per 2 extra noses, and a general penalty -15% on the negotiation rolls.
This mutation variant is a defect and does not count as a start up mutation.
The player should roll again on the Physical Mutations Table, or the Multiple Body Parts Table.

== 28) New Organ 

// insert table 924

This mutant has a specialized new organ that carries out peculiar processes that are not essential to the mutant's life, but can be helpful in prolonging it.
Unless specified otherwise, the mutations can be used as often as needed.
One roll on Table 59.15: New Organ is made, and each new organ type is discussed in the following passages.

// insert table 925

*1) Air Producing*: This enormous gland is located in the abdomen of the mutant and it breaks down bodily energy stores to produce air.
The air is secreted into the esophagus, and brought up into the mouth from there it is inhaled by the mutant.
She can breathe underwater with ease, hold her breath indefinitely, and kiss for hours.
In the case of inhaled poisonous substances +4 on her saving throw is granted, and half effect, or no damage is taken.
CR is increased by 2.

*2) Blood Absorbing*:Normally this mutation will be a blood producing organ that supplements the mutant's blood supply in case of injury.
The mutant will not not suffer damage from prolonged bleeding effects, nor will she have any problem with donating many times her total blood volume every day.
The organ is very sensitive, and will not aggravate internal injuries by pumping liters of blood into the persona's abdomen or skull.
The extra supply of blood keeps the persona from going into shock, easier to perform vet PT rolls on, and harder to knock unconscious.
The player doubles her persona's hit points when making a DSS roll, loses half as many hit points per turn when comatose, and gives vets a +15 PT roll bonus when working on her.
For more information about damage and healing refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=267[Chapter 13: Health].

There is a 15% chance that the mutant will have a blood draining organ.
This consists of an external blood sucking tentacle, and an internal blood filtering organ.
The large tentacle burrows to a major artery, injects anticoagulants, and aggressively pumps blood from the target.
The organ will drain 1 to 6 (d6) hit points worth of blood per experience level each unit that the blood draining tentacle is attached.
A 4th level mutant would dratn 4d6 worth of vital juices from her target each unit that the blood draining organ remains attached.
This attack increases the mutant's CR by 3.

A target will definitely be aware that the tentacle is attached, and she will make every effort to detach it.
A successful PSTR challenge will pull the tube out.
The tube can withstand 20% of the mutant's hit points maximum, before being knocked off the target.
If the tube goes to a negative total greater than 20% of the mutant's hit point maximum the tube has been severed.
For instance, if the mutant had 40 hit points, her tube could withstand 8 HPS before being knocked off the target.
If it were reduced to -8 HPS in one attack, the tube would be severed.
A severed blood tube will grow back in 1 to 6 months.
The blood draining tube cannot reach out of the mutant's hex.

*3) Electricity Storage*:This mutant has an organic rechargeable battery as her new organ.
The mutant can charge up this organ by draining small power cells.
The mutant can then recharge another power cell with the electricity stored in her organ.
The mutant can store a number of cells equal to her CON.

If the mutant has stored her maximum number of cells she can release all the energy at once in an electrical attack.
The attack will inflict a 1d8 per experience level of the mutant, and has a range of 1 hex.
A fully charge mutant will increase her CR by 1.

*4) Gas Absorbing*: The gas absorbing organ sits in the mouth and nose of the persona.
It will grow to cover the lower half of the mutant's face when activated.
The mutation is sometimes called an air liver because it filters anything airborne before it gets inside the mutant.
This makes her immune to most diseases, and very hardy against poisoned gases The mutant receives +5 on her saving throw against any gas attack, and is unaffected by those gases that must be inhaled.
If there is a dispute over whether a gas needs be inhaled or not the referee should consult the http://expgame.com/?page_id=275sphincter-dice[sphincter dice].
The organ also helps draw air out of the environment, and low oxygen atmospheres affect this mutant very little.
This mutation increases the mutant's CR by 2.

*5) Ink Producing*: This organ produces an enormous supply of fine black ink.
The gland opens on to the mutant's skin via a sphinkter in which she can clip a quill pen, and write until she dies of old age.

The ink can also be violently ejected in a liquid environment as a distracting screen (6 hexes by 9 hexes).
The screen will dissipate in 3 to 30 units.
The mutant can also spray her ink jet on land as a blinding attack against a single target.
The land attack has a range of 6 hexes, and a poison intensity (blinding), equal to half the attacker's CON.
The mutant will always have enough ink to write with, but can only eject it once a day per 4 points of adjusted CON.
This mutation increases the mutant's CR by 2.

*6) Iron Stomach*:This mutation is a two for one.
The mutant has a stomach that can digest anything that it encounters.
This includes metals, alloys, glass, toxins, plastics, and organic compounds.
The mutant will have an appropriately fortified mouth and esophagus to go with it.
The only complication is that this mutant also automatically has the mutation http://expgame.com/?page_id=36621-increased-metabolism[21) Increased M]http://expgame.com/?page_id=36621-increased-metabolism[etabolism].
The mutant will be constantly hungry, and may have difficulties to keep from eating computer parts and other essential artifacts.
Ingested poisons will have no effect on the mutant.

*7) Light Emitting*:A light emitting organ will continually carry out chemical reactions that produce light.
The organ can produce a radius of effect equal to 1 hex per experience level.

There is a 20% chance that the mutant has a light absorbing organ instead.
This amazing mutation absorbs ambient light, but has no effect on lazers, and other organized light sources.
This creates a blob of darkness around the mutant that grows by one hex per experience level.
The amount of darkness can be controlled by the mutant, and gives her a bonus of +15 on sneaky PT rolls in the dark.

*8) Mental Attack Absorbing*: This protective organ absorbs those waveforms which travel from thinkspace to thinkspace.
This has the effect of absorbing mental attacks against the mutant's thinkspace.[.Apple-converted-space]  The organ is reflected in a doubled MSTR when saving against a mental attack.
This organ is not intelligent, and will also interfere with beneficial mental mutation effects.
The mutation has no effect on those attacks which manipulate the environment around the target.
This mutation increases the mutant's CR by 4.

*9) Plastics Producing*:A plastic producing organ will allow the mutant to ooze plastic from some embarrassingly located orifice.
The plastic is malleable, warm and quick drying.
The plastic can come in any desired color, although once chosen, the colour cannot be changed.
The mutant can produce 1/10 of her body wate in plastic each day.

There is a 30% chance that this mutant will have glands that produce enzymes capable of destroying any plastic that it eats or licks.
It allows the mutant to damage plastic equipment, and eat plastic as a food source.

*10) Poison Producing*: Coursing throughout this mutant's body, and secreted through the pores on her skin is a naturally produced killing poison.
This poison has a random intensity of 3 to 12 (3d4), plus one point per level of experience.
Any close physical contact like a hug, punch, or kiss will subject the victim to a killing poison attack.
Veterinarians must take extra precautions when working on these mutants to avoid a poison attack.
This mutation increases the mutant's CR by 3.

*11) Pus Producing*: This lucky mutant has a gland that keeps to its constant task of spilling out pus, scum, cur, dregs or any other frothy grossness that the referee can imagine.
The randomly located opening cannot be plugged, or sewn shut, This mutation does not count as a start up mutation, and the player should receive another roll on the Physical Mutation Table.

== 29) Non Breathing 

// insert table 926

This mutant does not have to exchange gases in order to respire.
The mutant does not require light nor any particular ambient environmental factor in order to carry out her life processes.
The mutant does have to consume food, and larger than normal amounts of water.
At least 5 liters of water a day is needed to supply the mutant's biochemical reactions.
The mutant carries out all other biochemical processes that her race would, except that she does not breath.
Digestion is normal, blood is needed to carry nutrients and waste products around.
The mutant earns a +4 bonus to save on gas attacks that involve inhaled poisons.

== 30) No Resistance To Disease 

// insert table 927

Sadly this mutant is subject to who knows what diseases, and even has the pleasure of starting the campaign with one chronic non-terminal disease.
This mutant is three times as susceptible to diseases as other personas.
This disability cannot be rolled again, and it does not count as a start up mutation.

== 31) No Resistance To Poison 

// insert table 928

This mutant now has an effective resistance to poison of 0 to 3 (d4-1).
This means that when saving against poison she cannot use her CON for defence, but must use this random die roll.
Any bonuses that would normally be added to her saving throw still apply.
Pharmaceuticals that are imbibed have double effect, but the chance of side effects are tripled.
This disability cannot be rolled again, and it does not count as a start up mutation.

== 32) Oversized Body Parts 

// insert table 929

This mutation involves grossly oversized body parts that benefit the mutant in some manner.
The player makes a roll on Table 59.16: Oversized Body Parts.
The referee should keep in mind that the oversized body body parts will cause trouble for the mutant in the areas of clothing, armour, and public comments.

// insert table 930

== 33) Photosynthetic Skin 

// insert table 931

This mutant has light green, hairless, almost translucent skin.
The chloroplasts in her skin can act as a supplementary source of energy.
When her skin is exposed to the sun, she need not eat or breath, but she must continue to consume water at her normal rate.
While using photosynthesis the mutant can wear no covering what so ever, and she cannot photosynthesize in darkness, or artificial light.
If the conditions are right for photosynthesis the mutant will suffer no damage from bleeding, and she will heal five times faster than normal.
Damage from cold or heat based attacks add 1/2 damage if the mutant is using her photosynthesis.

== 34) Phosphorescent Skin 

// insert table 932

Through the production Â°flight retaining materials in the skin, this mutant continually glows some unique colour.
The light produced is barely enough to read by, but it is sufficient enough to be easily seen at night.
The mutant also registers as a radiation anomaly.

== 35) Poor Respiratory System 

// insert table 933

All the essential components of this mutant's respiratory system are substandard.
Her lungs are undersized, her blood is lacking in transport molecules, and gas exchange is bad at the tissues.
In general she will tire sooner in any endurance activities.
She immediately suffers a penalty of -1 on her CON+++<b>+++, +++</b>+++and -2 to on all saving throws versus poison.
This mutation is a defect and does not count as a start up mutation.
The player should make another roll on the Physical Mutations Table.

== 36) Pockets 

// insert table 934

This odd mutation consists of pockets or openings that can be covered by exterior flesh.
The mutant can manipulate the location, size and shape of the pockets on her body.
If she wants a big pocket on her tummy like a marsupial pouch, she can do so.
If she wants a dozen pockets all over her body she can dissipate the large one, and move the openings all over her body.
Each fleshy covering will create an airtight seal which can hold up to 2% of the mutant's body wate.
The total amount of stuff concealed in the mutant's body cannot exceed 5% of her body wate.

== 37) Pressurized Body 

// insert table 935

Throughout the mutant's body are organs that contain pressurized gases.
The mutant can release these gases into specialized cavities in her body, and puff out like a puffer fish.
Between this and her thick resilient skin the mutant can increase the pressure of her body to many time that of normal.

When in the pressurized state the mutant can fall a distance of 1 hex per adjusted PSTR without taking any damage.
If she falls from a height greater than her PSTR in hexes she will only take a d4 in damage per 2 hexes of distance.
All damage taken from force attacks (explosions, swords, rocks, car accidents) will be halved.
The mutant is unaffected by the pressure changes of decreased atmosphere, although she still must find some way to get air.

While pressurized there is a 1/1000 (1 per kilo die) chance per 10 HPS of damage taken that the mutant will explode.
So if this mutant took 20 HPS of damage the referee could check to see if the mutant explosively decompresses (2 in 1000 chance).
Exploding while pressurized will inflict 7 to 84 (7d12) hit points of damage to the mutant.
Bystanders are unaffected by explosive decompression of the mutation.
If the mutant chooses she can also explode right out of her armour inflicting 3 to 18 (3d6) hit points of damage to herself in the process.

== 38) Radiating Eyes 

// insert table 936

This mutant can launch a beam of radiation from her eyes.
The beam is about 30 cm wide and is two dimensional.
It appears to onlookers that the mutant has flashed yellow lazers at her targets.
The radiation beam and the mutant herself will register when detecting radiation.
The beam is composed of killing radiation with an intensity of 2-12 (2d6) plus one intensity per experience level.
The attack can be made every second unit of combat.
If the target's save is successful she will only take half damage from the attack.
Full damage is 1d4 per intensity of radiation.
For more information about saving throws and radiation poisoning see http://expgame.com/?page_id=275[Chapter 16: Special Rolls].

== 39) Regeneration 

// insert table 937

Every cell in this mutant's body is capable of recreating its nearest neighbour, and can do so with tremendous speed.
The mutation cannot regenerate lost limbs, but it can quickly repair the damage inflicted by wounds.

The mutant's body is constantly healing itself.
As long as she is not comatose (her hit point total is greater than 0) she will heal 1 hit point a unit for every 5 points of adjusted CON+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++This means that a 4th level mutant with a 16 +++<b>+++CON +++</b>+++would heal 4 HPS every unit.
The healing is complete and accurate.
There is no scarring, and the mutant is as good as new when she is returned to HPS Maximum.
This form of background regeneration does not work if the persona has less than 0 HPS+++<b>+++, +++</b>+++at this point she is dying like any other persona.

Massive reconstructive regeneration can be carried out automatically by the body, or whenever the mutant wishes.
Massive reconstruction involves the re-routing of blood, the slapping together of flesh, and the manipulation of other systems.
When this is done the mutant can instantly heal two HPS per point of adjusted CON+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++This can be carried out once a day per 7 points of adjusted CON+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++The body will instinctively carry out massive reconstruction if the mutant's HPS total drops below zero.
A 4th level mutant with a 10 CON could massively reconstruct 28 HPS worth of damage no more than twice a day.
If massive reconstructions is not sufficient to get the mutant up to a positive HPS total she will die like any other mutant.
See http://expgame.com/?page_id=267[Chapter 13: Health].

Regeneration will reject any foreign tissue attachments, grafts, or cybernetic connections vigorously.
The mutation is extremely self protective and will only accept its own reconstructions of its own tissues.

== 40) Rubbery+++<b>++++++</b>+++Skin 

// insert table 938

The mutant's skin is replaced by rubber.
This fabulous slippery skin comes in an assortment of wild and wonderful colours.
These colours, or even meticulous patterns can-be chosen by the player, or rolled randomly be the referee.
Rubbery skin can even be elaborately painted without any harm coming to the mutant.
The mutant is also immune to infections, parasites, skin conditions, or common colds.
The mutant need not wear any protective clothing in all but the harshest meteorological conditions.
Rubber dissolving aerosols will inflict 3 to 30 HPS of damage to this mutant.

== 41) Rust 

// insert table 939

Any metal touched by the mutant will instantly rust away.
This means any metal like substance touched by any part of the mutant will be spontaneously oxidized.
The mutant oxidizes the metal via an electromagnetic imbalance that is essential for maintaining her existence.

The body requires the change in electron status of the of metals in order to maintain equilibrium.
Each time the mutant touches something half her body wate in metal will oxidize into dust.
Not all metals are effected equally by the mutant, and the damaging effect can vary drastically.
Many artifacts are combinations of alloys, of metals and plastics, or wholly ceramic.
The sphincter dice described in http://expgame.com/?page_id=275[Chapter 16: Special]http://expgame.com/?page_id=275[Rolls] will be used to determine the metal content of such items.
The bottom line is that the mutant is unable to use anything mechanical.

In combat the rust mutation can be quite complicated.
Swords used against the mutant will only hit once before they are destroyed.
Bullets will disintegrate on impact, but they will still inflict their damage.
Robots will take 10 to 100 (10d10) hit points of damage, plus two rolls on the malfunction.
If a robot demolition table is being used simply move the bot down two levels on the demolition table.
The mutant need only touch the robot to inflict this damage, and she will receive a +500 bonus on her to hit roll.
Regardless of the wate of the robot, it will take only the damage indicated.
Robots are composed of many materials, and the rust mutation will severely damage them, not completely disintegrate them.

== 42) Self Destruction 

// insert table 940

Within the cells of this mutant's body is a biochemical byproduct of cellular respiration that is quite explosive.
If the neural signals coming from the mutant's stress center become too great there is a 1 in 1000 chance of the mutant self destructing in glorious technicolor.
The explosion is a dangerous one, inflicting a d10 in damage per experience level of the mutant.
The more experience the more of the chemical that has been deposited.
If by some means this biochemical byproduct is removed from the mutant's cells it will begin to deposit again, reaching explosive levels within hours.

Situations where a self destruction check is warranted are going into battle, losing a fellow expedition member, ending a ursidae frenzy, losing a game of checkers, or  if the player throws something at the referee.
A roll of 042 on kilodice will indicate self destruction.
This mutation may be kept secret from the player.
However this would not be nice.
This mutation is a defect and does not count as a startup mutation.
The player should get another roll on the Physical Mutations Table.
This mutant will keep setting off explosives detectors.

== 43) Shape Change 

// insert table 941

The mutant can completely rearrange the shape of her body.
She can change the pigmentation of her skin, and alter its texture to match anything that she has seen.
She can alter her internal structure to mimic the shape of any shape that she desires.
Ultimately the mutant can imitate the external structure of anything that she has seen.
The mutant's thinkspace is not strong enough to shape change into an imagined object, it must be something that she had visualized.
The mutant could shape change into anything, a large box, another persona, a robot, or an alien.

The mutant will not be able to recreate any of the special attacks that creature had, nor will she be able to record information like the previous machine could, nor will she be able to carry out any of the class skills that the persona had.
The mutant can alter her wate by more than 50% less, or 50% greater.
If the mimicked creature is much larger than the mutant she may turn herself into a scale replica of it.

The transformation takes 6 to 60 (6d10) units and is messy and noisy.
Bones have to be broken, major organs soften and are temporarily pushed out of the body, bodily fluids are released and then recovered, etc.
During this state the mutant is helpless, and any damage taken will be tripled.
The shape change being made cannot be adjusted while the transformation is taking place.

There is a 3% chance that the mutant will get stuck at the transformation phase, and lay unconscious for 0 to 5 (d6-1) days.
During this period she will slowly return to her normal shape.
The shape change will last for 1 minute (30 units) per point of adjusted CON.
At the end of this time the mutant will spontaneously shape change back into her normal form.

== 44) Size Manipulation 

// insert table 942

The mutant can cause the molecules of her body to fall in on each other just enough to decrease her size proportionally.
She can also cause them to expand slightly and therefore increase her size in a proportional fashion.
The changes are both immediate and complete.
The mutant's equipment is unaffected by the change, and this can result in oversized clothing, or tearing ones clothes asunder.

Making oneself smaller involves decreasing the space between every molecule in her body.
The result is proportional decrease is size that can make her up to 75% smaller.
There is no change in the mutant's body wate.
The decrease in size does not make her weaker, but it does make her a little bit more dense and harder to hit.
There is a bonus of +75 on her armour rating when the persona is shorter.

The mutant can increase her size by up to 50% when she slightly increases the space between her molecules.
There is no change on any of her attributes, a slight change in her density, but she can make herself considerably taller.
The mutant will receive a bonus of plus whatever percent she increased her size by onto her damage adjustment.
Note that her physical strength has not increased, but her leverage has.

== 45)  Skin Structure Change 

// insert table 943

This skin of this mutant has been radically altered to some genomic anomaly.
The majority of the skin structure changes are defensive in nature.
They all function as normal skin except for their described appearance, and change in base armour rating.
Refer to Table 59.17: Skin Structure Change to determine how the mutant's skin is different.
None of the skin alterations affect the mutant's CHA.
The altered skin structure is the mutant's natural skin.
When not wearing armour a mutant's armour rating is normally 500.
The Skin Structure Change table lists the changes to the mutant's AR.
This value is added to the mutant's AR regardless of how she is armoured.
If the mutant can wear armour with this mutation then her AR will be adjusted by the value.
Thus an unarmoured mutant with thatched skin would have an AR of 590, and any armour she were wearing would have a bonus  of +90.
Note that wearing armour may be an insulting idea to a mutant with naturally armoured skin.

// insert table 944

== 46) Smoke Screen 

// insert table 945

This mutant's back can heat up, ignite secretions located on her skin.
The combusting material will generate thick vision obscuring smoke.
The mutant can instantly heat up her back to generate the thick smoke.
The cloud does not inhibit one's ability to breath, but it is completely disorienting and cannot be seen through.
There is a chance that when the mutant is stressed she will instinctively release the cloud, say while talking to a banker, getting a speeding ticket, or in an argument with another persona.

If the mutant stands still the smoke will create a cloud 2 hexes high with a 5 hex radius.
If the mutant is moving she will create a wall of smoke 2 hexes high and 1 hex wide.
The wall of smoke will follow as she moves for 2 units.
The cloud will last for 1 to 12 minutes before settling or being dissipated.

There is also a 15% chance that the mutant will have an explosive smoke screen This smoke screen ignite violently when provoked by an open flame (match, gunfire, energy weapons).
Anything within the smoke screen at that moment will take 1d10 in damage per experience level of the mutant.

== 47)  Sonic Attack 

// insert table 946

There is a billows in this mutant's neck which allows her blast air through her specialized vocal cords.
The scream created is composed of high and low frequency wavelengths of damaging sound.
Immediately before the mutant attacks her neck billows out to beyond her nose.

The amount of damage inflicted is determined on Table 59.18: Sonic Damage Range.
The mutant is unaffected by her own sonic attack, unless it is somehow reflected back to her.
The sonic attack has a radius (in hexes) equal to the mutant's adjusted PSTR.
A 2nd level mutant with a 10 PSTR have a radius of effect of 12 hexes.
Organic and inorganic audio systems can be rendered inoperative if they take more than 15 hit points of damage.
If 15 (or more) hit points of damage is delivered a recovery roll must be made, or &8220;deafness&8221;
will result.
Organic systems will remain deaffor 1-8 hours, but inorganic audio systems must await repair.
Sonic attacks can be launched once a day for every two points of adjusted PSTR.

// insert table 947

== 48) Spit Poison 

// insert table 948

The mutant has poison producing glands that can eject a spittle of poison tremendous distances.
The gland requires a 3 unit wait period while it recharges itself.
Thus the mutant can spit poison every 4 units.
The type of poison generated by the mutant is determined on Table 59.19: Poison Generation.
The effects of each poison are discussed in the following paragraphs.

// insert table 949

*1) Death*:A highly toxic spittle of death is released by this mutant.
Any organic personas hit by this attack must save versus a poison.
Those who do not save will take damage from the attack.
This poison inflicts a 1d4 hit points in damage per point of poison intensity.
Those targets which do save will only take half damage.
The poison intensity is 1 to 8 plus experience level

*2) Nausea*:Those that fail their saving throw will be incapacitated with nausea.
They will be unable to act for 1 to 8 minutes (30 units).
Those that make their saving throw will be unaffected by the poison.
The poison intensity is 1 to 8 plus experience level.

*3) Paralysis*:The paralysis poison leaves its affected targets unable to move any of their voluntary muscles for 3 to 30 (3d10) units.
The save must be made by anyone that is hit by the spittle.
Those that make their saving throw will be unaffected by the poison.
The poison intensity is 1 to 8 plus experience level.

*4) Unconsciousness*:This nasty spittle causes instantaneous unconsciousness for those organic creatures that do not save vs poison.
Targets will remain unconscious until awakened.
In a normal combat setting this would be 0 to 3 units.
Otherwise they will lay dormant for days.
Those that make their saving throw will be unaffected by the poison.
The poison intensity is 1 to 8 plus experience level.

== 49) Static Quills 

// insert table 950

This mutant's body is completely covered with quills, spines, thorns and other nasty pointy things.
The layer of quills is thick and offers an armour rating bonus of +101, but the mutant is unable to wear armour of any sort.
She even has a slight chance of puncturing a vac suit.
Any type A attack that involves a creature's punch, bite, or claw will inflict a 1d6 plus 1 hit point per level of damage to the attacker.
Thus a 5th level mutant with static quills would have an armoured armour rating of 601, and would inflict 6 to 11 HPS of damage to any creature that attempts (makes a to hit roll) against her.+++<figure id="attachment_5364" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5364" style="width: 218px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i2.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tentaclesmutation.688-218x300.png?resize=218%2C300[Strange new body parts.,218]](https://i1.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tentaclesmutation.688.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5364" class="wp-caption-text">+++Strange new body parts.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== 50) Strange New Body Parts 

// insert table 951

Just like the title of the mutation states the mutant has some strange new body part that is uncommon to her species.
If the body part rolled on Table 59.20: Strange New Body Parts is not unique to her persona's species, then the player can roll again.
The strange new body parts are discussed in the following paragraphs.

// insert table 952

*1) Antennae*:The mutant has a pair of insectoid like antennae sticking out of the top of her head.
There is a 90% chance that the antennae will give the mutant a sensor skill similar in effect to Sonar (Mental Mutation ).

*2) Ears*:The mutant has a pair of unique ears, large elephant ears, or floppy rabbit ears.
The ears are purely decorative, and this mutation does not count as a startup mutation.
The player can roll again on the Physical Mutation Table.

*3) Eyes*: Giant bug out oversized reflective eyes give this mutant a wide angle view of life.
Improving the chance to notice ambush by doubling her AWE during ambush.

*4) Eyestalks*: The mutant's eyes are now located atop retractable and articulated eyestalks.
The mutant can extend her eyes from her head by about 30 cm.
She could use these to increase her cover when firing around a corner.

*5) Fins*: The mutant will have a dorsal stabilizing fin, and webbed hands and feet.
This mutation will allow any persona to swim in water at a speed equal to her movement rate on land.

*6) Gills*:These gills are located on the side of the mutant's neck, and offer her an additional breathing apparatus.
The gills function both in and out of water, and allow her to breath in liquid.

*7) Horns*:The mutant has a set of horns sticking out of the sides of her head.
There will be 1 to 4 pairs of horns located on her head.
The horns are purely decorative, and do not count as a start up mutation.
The player can roll again on the Physical Mutation Table.

*8) Mouth*:The mutant's mouth is replaced with some other sort of obscure oral access device.
Like a beak, trunk, proboscis, or an osmotic absorptive sheet.
The strange new mouth is purely decorative, and does not count as a start up mutation.
The player can roll again on the Physical Mutation Table.

*9) Nose*:This mutant has a strange new nose.
It can be missing, inverted, elephant like, clown like, merely a hole, or some other peculiar variation.
The strange new nose is purely decorative, and does not count as a start up mutation.
The player can roll again on the Physical Mutation Table.

*10) Oral Grapple*:This is a metal covered bone shaped like a grappling hook.
The mutant can shoot the oral grapple from her mouth.
It has a range of 2 hexes and attacks as a type B weapon.
Anything that the grapple hits will take 1d8 in damage, and have grapple firmly lodged into it.
The mutant can retract, and release the grapple at will.
The mutant can reel the oral grapple in using her PSTR.
The oral grapple will be severed if it takes more than 15% of the mutant's hit point maximum in one attack.
A severed grapple will grow back in 1 to 6 months.

*11) Pincers*:Protruding from the mutant's mouth are a pair of large serrated pincers.
The mutant can dexterously manipulate her food with these pincers, or she can use them to violently attack as a type A weapon.
If a hit is scored they will inflict 1 to 8 (1d8) hit points in damage.

*12) Spike*:The spike resembles a unicorn's spike sticking from the persona's forehead, and it can be used in the same fashion.
The spike can be used as a type A weapon that inflicts 1 to 12 (1d12) HPS in damage.

*13) Tail*: The mutant has a nice long articulated tail protruding from her hindquarters.
This tail can be used to manipulate objects, or to lift the mutant from the ground.
The tail is fully functional and acts as an extra articulation.

*14) Tentacles*:The mutant will have 1 to 6 tentacles replacing 1 to 4 limbs.
Each tentacle rolled will replace one limb.
If there are 5 or 6 tentacles replacing 4 limbs then the mutant will have 1 or 2 extra limbs.
She will be able to use the extra limbs as arms or legs depending on what is needed at the time.
For example, she could have extra attacks, or increase her movement by 10% per extra limb.

*15) Turtle Shell*:This mutant has a fully functional turtle shell into which she can retract her arms, legs, head and what ever other appendages she has.
The shell is very strong, and when completely retracted into it the mutant's AR is 777, and she is immune to poisons, gases, and has a doubled CON versus radiation.
The shell can withstand twice the mutant's HPS Maximum before it will break.
The turtle shell will heal one quarter the normal healing rate.
This mutation increases the mutant's CR by 3.


== 51) Symbiotic Attachment 

// insert table 953

Externally this mutation appears as a long umbilical cord with a gnarly suction cup attached to the end.
The cord is an extension of the mutant's nervous system, and the cup at the end has all the agents, enzymes and neurotransmitters necessary to take over another creatures nervous system.
There is a 17% chance that the mutant will have a symbiotic attachment that can interface with inorganic machines.

The mutant must first score a to hit roll near the mutant's central nervous system.
This to hit roll must be successful even if the target wishes to be attached.
The next unit the target gets a saving throw versus poison (the attacker's neurotransmitters), and if she fails the mutant completely controls the target.
The intensity of the attack is equal to the mutant's adjusted CON.
The target must make a save, or be controlled, every unit that the symbiotic attachment is connected to her.
Each unit that the target is struggling she will take 1 to 3 hit points in daniage.
An unconscious target can be automatically controlled without the benefit of a saving throw.

During the struggle the target can pull the attachment from her body if she successfully makes a PSTR attribute roll.
This will inflict 2d4 HPS of damage to herself, but it will remove the attachment.
The umbilical cord can be severed if it takes more than 20% of the mutant's HPS Max in one attack.
A severed symbiotic attachment will be treated as any other severed limb.
Any damage done to the cord will be delivered to the mutant also.

If control is successful the mutant completely controls the body that she has attached to, and has access to all memories skills and abilities that the target has.
The player has essentially extended her mutant to two personas.
10% of any damage taken by the attached creature will be delivered to the controlling mutant.
The attached creature will be freed if the mutant allows her to go, or if the controlling mutant is knocked unconscious.
If the mutant is knocked unconscious by something that doesn't affect her target the target is free.+++<figure id="attachment_5365" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5365" style="width: 249px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i1.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/detachablehands.690.png?resize=249%2C181[Seeing is in the hands of the beholder.,249]](https://i1.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/detachablehands.690.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5365" class="wp-caption-text">+++Seeing is in the hands of the beholder.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== 52) Tearaway Body Parts 

// insert table 954

Under the correct circumstances the mutant can remove parts of her body while keeping them under her mental control.
The mutation is as disgusting as imaginable.
The mutant could tear off an arm and have it to open a door while she stands far away from the area.
She could remove an eye and leave it in a room to carry out some spying, or tack an ear to the wall to listen in on a conversation.
If the mutant were to leave an eye and an arm somewhere she would be able to attack from far away.
When the job was done she could get the arm to gather the eye and crawl back to the mutant.

The mutant can keep track of 1 loose body part per two levels of experience.
The mutant must be within 1 hex per adjusted MSTR of her body part.
If she leaves the range of effect the body part will immediately begin to decompose.
As it is the mutant can only leave a part detached from her body for up to 1 hour per point of adjusted CON, without it beginning to decompose.

Body parts have a HPS total equal to 10% of the mutant's HPs maximum.
This amount of hit points is set regardless of the size or importance of the detached body part.
If the body part should start to decompose it will take a 1d8 in hit points each hour it is left unattended.
If the body part is reduced to zero hit points for any reason it is dead, and the mutant cannot reattach it.
The mutant does not have any ability whatsoever to regenerate her dead body parts.

== 53) Undersized Body Parts 

// insert table 955

This mutation is a defect that should be obvious to all concerned personas.
The mutant has some body part that is obviously undersized, altering the persona's attributes, and shape.
This mutation is a defect and does not count as a start up mutation.
The player should roll again on the Physical Mutation Table.

// insert table 957

== 54) Vibrations 

// insert table 956

The neurons in this mutant's body can set up harmonic patterns which cause her hand to vibrate at predetermined frequencies.
This mutant can call on her hands to produce a relaxing comforting pulse at any time.
This skill can be used to soothe other personas with an incredible massage.

During combat or other periods of stress the mutant can vibrate her hands at super high frequencies which will allow her to damage anything that she touches.
When attacking with type A punching attacks she will inflict an extra 3d4 hit points of damage if she hits, and she will receive a bonus +97 to hit with punching attacks.
Combat vibrations can be employed for 1 unit per point of adjusted PSTR.
Damaging vibrations can only be initiated once a day per 3 points of adjusted DEX*.*

If she punches or holds something specifically intending to break it the mutant can quadruple her PSTR when making such an attribute roll.
This can only be done on stationary inorganic objects and cannot be achieved during combat.
A successful PSTR attribute roll will shatter what ever she is concentrating on.
This would count as one of the daily uses of the mutation.

== 55) Vision Defect 

// insert table 959

The optical sensors of this mutant are somehow defective in a peculiar sort of way.
The mutation is challenging to run for the referee since these eye defects will only come into effect every once in a while.
The player makes one roll on Table 59.22: Vision Defect, and the table describes what effect the defect has on the mutant.
This mutation is a defect and does not count as a startup mutation.
The player should roll again on the Physical Mutation Table.

_// insert table 958_

== 56) Wate Manipulation 

// insert table 961

This mutant can adjust her body wate at will.
She can instantly increase her wate by absorbing water and airborne particles and plumping herself up.
The mutant will not appreciably increase in size, but she will appear to bloat.
When manipulating her wate upwards she is capable of tripling her body wate.
Conversely the mutant can spew out frothy jets of unnecessary bodily fluids and jellies to decrease her body wate to a third what it regularly is.
There is no noticeable decrease in the mutant's size, but she will appear much thinner.

The benefits of altering ones wate are the obvious ones.
The mutant becomes easier to carry, or harder to move.
The mutant can fall with more force, or they can climb more easily.
In movement the mutant will move 50% slower when heavier, and 25% faster when lighter.
There is also a +25% bonus on non-powered weapons damage adjustments when attacking in the wate increased form.
The mutant will return to her normal wate if she is knocked unconscious.

== 57) Wings 

// insert table 962

Regardless of this mutant's race she will have a lovely set of wings which arise from her back.
These wings allow the mutant to fly through the air with the greatest of ease.
All encumbrance effects as described in http://expgame.com/?page_id=279[Chapter 18: Encumbrance], apply to the flying mutant.
The mutant will be able to fly at a base rate that js twice her land movement rate.
If the mutant's speed is particularly fast she may be required to make driving maneuver rolls for certain actions.
Maneuver rolls are discussed in http://expgame.com/?page_id=277[Chapter ]http://expgame.com/?page_id=277[17: Driving].
The mutant would have to be flying faster than 18 h/u to before being required to make driving PT rolls.
The wingspan of the mutant is such that she is unable to fly indoors, requiring at least a 2 hex wide corridor for maneuvering, and at least a 3 hex ceiling.



=== Defective Mutations

The Defective Mutations Subtable:Table 59.2, Defective Physical Mutations Subtable is a very specific subtable used by the referee when she desires to roll a defective mutation, but does not wish to keep rolling the Physical Mutations table until she gets one A roll of 86 on this table would indicate physical mutation 53, Undersized Body Parts.

include::ROOT:partial$CH59_Table_Defective_Physical_Mutations.adoc[]

=== Combat Mutations

The Combat Physical Mutations is used by the referee when she desires to roll a combat mutation, but does not wish to keep rolling the Physical Mutations table until she gets one.
Players do not use this table unless they are specifically directed to acquire a combat mutation.


include::ROOT:partial$CH59_Table_Combat_Physical_Mutations.adoc[]

=== Non Combat Mutations

The Non-Combat Physical Mutations subtable is used by the referee when she desires to roll a non combat mutation, but does not wish to keep rolling the Physical Mutations table until she gets one.

include::ROOT:partial$CH59_Table_Non-Combat_Physical_Mutations.adoc[]
