= Miscellaneous Equipment

IMPORTANT: *Welcome friend of EXP. You are in an unfinished section of EXP. Please ignore.*


Miscellaneous equipment is the specialized equipment chapter.
Any device that is important, but too small to warrant its own chapter is included on this list.
Examples are visual aids, computers, lights, and special ammunition.
Also included in miscellaneous equipment are the incredibly unique devices.
Examples of these are dehydrators, and tesseract boxes.
The miscellaneous equipment chapter is sorrowfully inadequate.
There is an unlimited number of fun devices that haven't been included, or had to be omitted.
Much of the equipment has gone past the line of science fantasy, and into the realm of pure fantasy.
Whereas everything else in this game is very realistic (ha!).
Often the equipment has no pseudo-scientific explanation, and it is up to the ref to fit the artifact into her milieu.

//+++<figure id="attachment_10130" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10130" style="width: 265px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i0.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tom_corbett-265x300.png?resize=265%2C300[THE SPACE PIONEERS THE TOM CORBETT SPACE CADET STORIES By Carey Rockwell 1953 Illustrator Louis Glanzman,265]](https://i0.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tom_corbett.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-10130" class="wp-caption-text">+++Detector detector detecting detectors.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

The miscellaneous equipment is generally non-combat.
Many of the devices aid in combat, but they are not designed to inflict damage solely on their own.
If a device were a gun, it would be in the gun chapter, if it were a weapon, it would be in the miscellaneous weapon chapter, and so on.
For many players, devices with no combat application have no obvious use.
It is true that only those players with that special insight'
will always find a use for the equipment rolled in this chapter.
Despite these observations, some of the miscellaneous equipment is incredibly powerful, but not necessarily violent.
Judiciously limiting such device's use (read, being ruthless) will help maintain the balance of the game.

== Vocation 
Vocation represents the persona vocation whom this particular miscellaneous device was designed for.
Unlike the other technology chapters, whose likely users are described in the title of the chapter, like guns are for mercenaries, and medical equipment is for veterinarians.
The miscellaneous equipment chapter knows no such allegiances, and each artifact is designated to a certain persona vocation.
The vocation heading will usually indicate a particular vocation.
If the vocation statistic says `mech', then the device is designed for mechanics.
If the artifact is labelled `spie', then it is a piece of spying equipment.
The vocation heading may be labelled All', and these toys are useable by any persona vocation.
None'
states that no vocation should be familiar with the equipment.

The vocation heading doesn't restrict personas from using the vocation equipment, but it does indicate certain effects.
A vocation related toy is easier to identify, and this is reflected by an artifact identification bonus (http://expgame.com/?page_id=284[see chapter 20]).
The persona will also receive an EXPS bonus when identifying vocation related equipment (http://expgame.com/?page_id=273[see chapter 15]).
The only drawback of a vocation related artifact is that it will count the a last roll for a player generating toys.
If the toy states All'
as well as a vocation then the artifact will not count as a last roll.
If the vocation is None then it does not count as a last roll.

== Duration 
Duration indicates how much use the device can endure before the battery set must be replaced.
Straight time usage is usually indicated in thousands of units.
It would be unusual for a battery set to run down, but who knows, it may happen just when the device is most important!
Other toys have a predetermined number of uses before the battery set must be replaced.
Devices with One use'
usually consume themselves to reach their objective.
The last type of duration is power source'.
These are artifacts that require enormous power plants like nuclear generators, and hydroelectric dams.

== Wate 
This is the wate of the device excluding batteries and other paraphernalia.
This value is added to the persona's wate allowance if she intends to carry the artifact.
Many of the miscellaneous equipment are everyday devices with certain luxury features thrown in.
If, even with these special extras, the toy seems too heavy, the referee can adjust the tech level so that an acceptable wate is obtained.

== EXPS 
The EXPS value is awarded to the persona who identifies the device.
If the device is vocation related she can earn an experience point bonus.
For more information on experience points see http://expgame.com/?page_id=273[Chapter 15: ]http://expgame.com/?page_id=273[Experience].


== Value 
The Value is what the toy would be worth if it were ever correctly appraised, which is unlikely.
The values are also relative worth in the campaign to other devices that can be found.
It is expected that the referee will adjust the value of artifacts as she sees fit in her campaign.

== Miscellaneous Equipment Type 

To determine the type of miscellaneous equipment roll on Table 48.1: Miscellaneous Equipment.

include::ROOT:partial$CH48_Table_Miscellaneous_Equipment_Type.adoc[]

== 1) Absorber 

// insert table 644

Absorbers are capable of eliminating environmental components that are harmful to organic creatures.
The absorbers are industrial strength air cleaners that counteract harmful agents like radiation, gas, and smoke.
The devices all operate on unknown electrochemical and mechanical principles that allow the referee to ignore any problems regarding the laws of conservation of mass.
All absorbers have the same specifications and abilities.
They eliminate the substance in question in a non-violent manner.

They have a 3 hex radius of effect in which the absorbed material will have absolutely no effect.
For instance a radiation absorber would reduce the effects of radiation within the 3 hex area of effect for the duration of the battery set.
The absorber will also clean up an area around itself, by drawing in and neutralizing the offending substance.
The durations of substances like smoke, radiation and gas clouds are reduced to 1/3 if their area of effect and duration.
For those absorbers that can absorb damage, each HPS of damage absorbed counts as 1 hour of battery life.


// insert table 645

== 2) Aerosol Regulator 

// insert table 1061

The aerosol regulator has no false advertisements in its title, it simply regulates aerosols.
The cap-like device snaps onto an aerosol, restraining its all-in-one-use nature.
The aerosol regulator will yield 1-4 additional uses for an aerosol which normally only yields one use.
The aerosol regulator cannot be removed until all charges are spent.
The device can also moderate the effect of any non-combat aerosol.
Paint aerosols will act like normal paint canisters, and foam aerosols will dispense like shaving cream.

== 3) Ammunition 

// insert table 646

This ammo is special ammunition for guns found in chapter 46.
It is actually more like bizarre ammo.
The ammo is designed for bolt action rifles, derringers, semi-automatic weapons, full-auto pistols/rifles, job pistols/rifles and revolvers.
These are the typical weapons which explosively launch bullets.
Other special weapons (fusion, plasma) do not have special ammo.
Ammunition for such guns, as with normal ammo, is generated in chapter 55, Support Equipment.
Roll on Table 48.3, +++<i>+++Special +++</i>++++++<i>+++Ammo +++</i>+++to determine the special ammunition type.
Generally 1 to 1000 rounds will be found.
Whether, or not, ammo fits available weapons is determined by the referee.
Whether or not ammo fits an available weapon can be determined by rolling http://expgame.com/?page_id=275sphincter-dice[s]http://expgame.com/?page_id=275sphincter-dice[phincter dice].

// insert table 647

== 4) Anti Grav Backpack 

// insert table 648

The anti grav backpack generates a force field that counteracts gravity to reduce the wate of equipment that is stores.
Anything placed inside the backpack will be reduced to one tenth its normal wate.
If the backpack should get turned off, it will have a wate of 15 kg plus the regular wate of all equipment stored within it.
The backpack has a maximum capacity of 200 kg of equipment.
This device offers no benefits to the wearer other than wate allowance.
For instance the anti grav backpack will not allow the persona to fly, fall slowly, or reduce her wate in high gravity atmospheres.

== 5) Anti Grav Beam 

// insert table 649

An antigrav beam generates anomalous gravity between 0 and 2 gravities in a one hex area of effect, up to 5 hexes away.
The beam requires too much fine tuning and adjustment to be used on anything other than voluntary subjects.
When the beam is aimed into the same hex as the persona using it, she can lift herself into the air and defy gravity.
This box can be used to overcome gravity effects.
This will allow the expedition to lift large or delicate objects out of the way, or up in the air to ease repair.
The maximum wate of the object that can be effected is 20 tonnes.
The antigrav beam can be used to rotate objects into any position needed.
The antigrav beam will assist any persona making a manipulation PT roll will earn a bonus of +5.

== 6) Anti Grav Belt 

// insert table 650

The antigrav belt is a device which shows that even sadistic refs write rules.
The a-g belt is a support device which keeps a persona's trousers from dropping.
A similar version of the belt can be used to replace a brassiere.
So depending on the mood of the ref, the player will have rolled either a a-g pant helder, or an a-g brassiere.
Refer to antigrav boots for the type of antigrav equipment most personas think of.

//+++<figure id="attachment_5330" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5330" style="width: 245px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i0.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/antigravboots.495.png?resize=245%2C193[Light on your feet.,245]](https://i0.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/antigravboots.495.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5330" class="wp-caption-text">+++Light on your feet.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== 7) Anti Grav Boots 

// insert table 651

Antigrav boots are the typical anti grav unit thought of by most players.
Anti grav boots allow the wearer to fly about without the worries of gravity.
The gravity repulsion unit can operate for about 10 days before the battery set runs out.
The anti grav boots can come in a belt form which has a wate of 16 kg.
The anti grav boots will work on personas up to 150 kg in wate.
Either antigrav unit (boots or belt) can travel at up to 25 h/u, hover, fly upside down, fly sideways, etc.
If the persona is trying a particularly crazy maneuver then consult the driving performance tables.
The antigrav device is very maneuverable, and has a handling vocation equal to the persona's DEX.

== 8) Anti Anti Grav 

// insert table 652

The anti anti grav beam is also called an anti grav neutralizer.
The device normalizes gravity fields that have been manipulated by anti grav devices.
The beam has the effect of negating anti grav units, gravruptor attacks, or any other non-natural gravity anomalies.
The device essentially returns manipulated gravity to normal.
Any devices generating anomalous gravitational fields will instantly  shut off for 1 to 20 units.
The number of units of dysfunction equals the percentage chance of the machine being damaged.

For instance if the neutralizer were used on an antigrav back pack, the back pack would crash to the floor.
If the pack were disabled for 14 units there would be a 14% chance of the backpack's anti grav unit being damaged.
See http://expgame.com/?page_id=286[Chapter 21: ]http://expgame.com/?page_id=286[Equipment Damage] for more information.
The anti grav neutralizer has a range of 25 hexes, and offers a +10 PT roll bonus when working with gravity manipulation devices .

== 9) Antigrav Pushcart 

// insert table 653

The anti grav push cart is often called a wheel-less barrow.
The gravity repulser plate will nullify the wate of any object less than 50 tonnes.
The pushcart must be placed under the object, and the barrow will not raise the object any higher than 20 cm off the ground.
The device has safety features which restrict the height of the repulser plate to one where the load will not fall a damaging distance.
Balance, while on the plate, is unimportant since there is no gravity to tip the object over.
The anti grav pushcart can operate for 5 days on one battery set.
The plate's max speed is 5 h/u, less 1 h/u per 10 tonnes of wate.
The minimum speed is 1 h/u.
A PT roll bonus of +14 is granted to any lifting PT rolls made with this device.

== 10) Attractors 

// insert table 654

Attractors are heavy boxes that employ an unusual array of chemical, pheromonal, gravitational, magnetic, or even stranger mechanisms to redirect objects in motion.
The objects can be waves of energy, animals, or projectiles.
An attractor can be used 5 times per battery set.
Roll on Table 48.4: Attractor Type+++<i>++++++</i>+++to see what the device attracts.


// insert table 655

Ballistic*:This device has a 10 hex radius.
Any high velocity ballistic projectile that passes through this device's area of effect will have a 50% chance of being diverted on a course that will transect the hex that the device is in.
Thus if the attractor is lying on the ground the attack will hit the ground.
The device can be used to foul up incoming bullets, or be used to target an artillery attack.

R**obots*: If this device is used there is a 50% chance that the next encounter will be robotic.
If it is used in a robot laden milieu then there is a chance that robots will stop what they are doing and come inspect the attractor.
Combat robots are NOT immune to this and this attractor can be very useful.
Robots will enjoy a control factor check to prevent being attracted (referee persona and persona robots are affected).
This device should not be used to overturn a milieu.
This attractor's value is triple the listed value at 100 000.

Communications*:Any electromagnetic waves transporting data that travel within the 5 kilometer radius of this black box will be redirected towards the device.
This attractor can only redirect radio waves, microwaves, and other standard wave form communications.
A  lazer communicator would be unaffected.
This device cannot receive the communications, but it does redirect them.
While this would destabilize an entire communications network, it cannot be used to listen.

Creatures*:When this device is used, there is a 50% chance that the next encounter will be of the specified type.
To determine the creature type attracted, and its effects on the creature, refer to the physical mutation 3, attraction Odor.

Energy*:Any energy weapon's projectile that passes through this artifact's 10 hex radius of effect will have a 50% chance of being redirected towards the energy attractor.
Electromagnetically transferred energy sources within a 5 kilometer radius will also be attracted towards this box (like power lines).
Such energy sources, when diverted, will bathe the area in intensity 1-10 radiation.

Lazers*: Any lazer projectile that passes within the 10 hex radius of the attractor will have a 50% chance of diverting towards the attractor.
Any lazer communications within a 5 kilometer radius will divert towards the attractor.
These communications cannot be listened to but are diverted to the attractor.

Projectiles*: Projectiles flying within the 10 hex radius of the attractor have 50% chance of changing direction towards the attractor.
Projectiles are low velocity objects like daggers, arrows, rocks, or grenades (Type B weapons).

== 11) Auto Lock Pick 

// insert table 656

The computerized, automated, robotic lockpick is designed to unlock mechanical key lock doors without damaging the lock or door, and without tripping any alarms.
The auto lock pick must be correctly attached by a spie.
This requires a successful PT roll (DD2), and then the auto lock pick has a 90% chance of success.
Simply attaching the auto lock pick without casing the door previously will reduce the chance of success to 60%.
Random attachment, by a vocation other than spie, yields a 40% chance of success.
The success roll is made by the referee, because failure may open the door, but activate silent alarms.
The auto lock pick does not work on electronic or keyless doors.

== 12) Auto Holster 

// insert table 657

The auto holster is a spring loaded pistol attachment which, when the persona's hand is in the firing position, launches the gun into her ready grip.
The auto holster will not release the gun unless it contacts a hand.
When using this device the persona can draw faster because several steps of the process are carried out simultaneously.
The device gives the persona +5 on her DEX in any quick draw situation.
It also allows the persona to use the pistol during any stage of ambush, but she cannot move.
The auto holster can be adjusted to rapid reach rifles, special detectors or medi-kits.

== 13) Auto Brush 

// insert table 658

The auto brush is a handheld device that sprays chemicals onto surfaces that discolour the material.
The autobrush is a glorified paint dispenser.
The colour, texture, and the width of each stroke is manipulated by the grip on the brush.
This brush is designed for fine arts, and not for commercial overcoating.

== 14) Auto Card 

// insert table 659

The autocard is electronic version of the http://expgame.com/?page_id=34311-auto-lock-pick[auto lock pick].
The auto card is an illegal device created for the exclusive use of bypassing security.
The spie uses this auto card to reprogram entry key cards for electronic doors, bank machines and debit registers.
The device is attached to or held near the keyless lock and the user works with the device's on board computer to wiggle past encryption.
When using the auto card spies and mechanics will earn a +20 bonus when attempting to bypass electronic security systems.

== 15) Battery Power Plug 

// insert table 660

The power plug will attach to a power outlet, and transfer the seemingly limitless energy into equipment designed for batteries.
For instance the power plug could be connected between the wall outlet in a building, and the battery helder in a lazer rifle to give the lazer rifle unlimited ammunition.
There is a 75% chance that one of the power plug's accesses will be compatible with the outlet of the power source (this includes broadcast power).
If none fit, a mechanic may adapt the power plug with a DD6 maneuver.
The battery power plug will offer a +15 bonus for the mech when making any battery, or power source PT rolls.

The battery type that the power plug can insert into is limited to one of the 6 battery types listed on Table 48.5: Power Plug Battery Type+++<i>+++.
+++</i>+++The power plug will have 1 to 3 extra extension cords, each being 3 hexes in length.
Each extension cord will service from 11-20 (1d10+10) batteries.

For example a power plug would have a 75% chance of being able to plug into a wall outlet, and have 2 extension cords that can each power an artifact that uses up to 15 batteries.

// insert table 661

== 16) Battery Slut 

// insert table 662

A battery slut (ed.
note even in 1990 slut was a gender neutral term) is a device which receives any battery type into it, and converts it into the needed battery type. The battery slut usually hangs from a belt pack, with a cord running from the artifact taking power.
The slut will hold 1-20 cells of any kind.
These cells must be the same tech level.
The battery slut can also be used as a power pack for very efficient toys.

== 17) Battery Recharger 

// insert table 663

A battery recharger will recharge batteries of a certain type back to their full charge.
For each battery recharging, a deci-die roll must be made.
If the deci-die roll is less than 3 the battery is permanently dead, and cannot be recharged.
If the die roll equals +++<b>+++1, +++</b>+++then the battery will explode inflicting a d4 in damage to the recharger.
The battery recharger will be able to recharge 3-18 batteries at once (limited number of helders).
The battery recharger must be connected to a major power source.
Recharging takes 8 hours.
Refer to Table 48.5: Power Plug Battery Type__ __to determine what kind of batteries are recharged.

// insert table 661

== 18) Bot Neutralizer 

// insert table 664

The robot neutralizer is the control baton  of miscreant robots.
The neutralizer disconnects robots from their power, which brings them grinding to a complete halt, provided that the halt does not severely damage the bot or its manufacturing anthro type.
The bot neutralizer has a chance of failure equal to the robot's control factor, and this chance cannot be greater than 80%.
Thus a robot that has a 25 control factor has a 25% chance of not being affected by the neutralizer.
If the robot's control factor is 97, then there is an 80% chance of evading the neutralization.
Thus the more domesticated the bot,  the easier it is to control.
If left alone the robot will regain control of itself after 3 to 300 units.

The device has one complicating effect: if a neutralized robot is subject to the attack again, it will be immediately reactivated.
Since the bot neutralizer has an 8 hex radius of effect, robots can be turned on and off each time the device is used.
Mechanics will earn a bonus of +15 on any robot related PT rolls.

//+++<figure id="attachment_5331" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5331" style="width: 248px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i2.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/atomizer.500.png?resize=248%2C177[Jail time cancelled.,248]](https://i2.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/atomizer.500.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5331" class="wp-caption-text">+++Jail time cancelled.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== 19) Cancellers 

// insert table 665

The canceller safely disperses matter into its useless components.
A canceller can disperse 1 hex of matter per use.
The wate of the dispersed substance is not important, because personas are usually trying to pass by a barrier.
The device has industrial safeguards which only allow the canceller to disperse homogeneous, or simple substances.
Complex items such as robots or organics will prevent the canceller from functioning.
Roll on Table 48.8: Cancelled Substance to determine what the canceller will disintegrate.

// insert table 666

== 20) Climate Band 

// insert table 667

The climate band is a non-combat, personal force field which defends the persona against non-violent meteorological effects.
The persona is contained in a form fitting force field that will protect the persona from temperatures between -50°C and +50°C.
The climate band will counter any meteorological such as: windchill factor, precipitation, hypothermia, heatstroke, sand storms, etc.
A battery set will last five days.
This force field can only operate in earth-like atmospheres, and the climate band cannot counter poisonous atmospheres.**

== 21) Climate Portent

// insert table 668

The climate portent is a translucent force field that is shaped like a tent.
The climate portent can protect its guests from any but the most extreme meteorological conditions.
The portent will hold anywhere from 2 to 16 anthropomorph (medium sized) personas.
This force field offers no protection from combat attacks, or poisonous gases.
The climate portent will only work in earth-like atmospheres.

== 22) Clothing 

// insert table 669

Clothing includes a complete suit of stuff socks, pants, shirts, jacket, boot covers, and a helmet net, hat of hoody.
The clothing is specialized, and its weird nature can be determined on Table 48.7: Clothing Type+++<i>+++.
+++</i>+++Special clothing can be replaced by a single cloak (30% chance) in order for it to be worn over bulky armour.
Clothing cannot be used in conjunction with powered armour.

// insert table 671

[.s52]Compu camo *(10000) Compu cammo is a sheet of photocell detectors and photocell emitters.
The detectors on one side the suit alter the emitters on the opposite side of the suit.
This dynamic camouflage projects what is behind the persona onto the front of the suit making the wearer virtually invisible.
When this suit is activated observers must make a normal (d20) AWE** **attribute** **roll to notice the persona.
If the persona remains motionless and is actively hiding observers must make an tough (d50) AWE** **attribute** **roll.
If the wearer engages in combat at all she will be seen with an easy (d10) AWE* *roll, and if she damages a target they will be able to see her normally.
Attribute rolls are covered in more detail in http://expgame.com/?page_id=275attribute-rolls[Chapter 16].
Compu cammo will assist sneaky PT rolls with +40 to the die roll.
Compu camo clothing is considered spie and nomad equipment.

Computerized* (2000) This clothing will always be a full tuxedo suit.
Throughout the suit are detectors which analyze the clothing around the room, and automatically tailor the suit to match the crowd.
This is carried out by retractable filaments that adjust the suit's shape, and photo emitters that subtlety alter the suit's colour.
This will award the persona with a bonus of +200 on her social standing, and +2 on CHA while wearing the suit.
This considered a nothing vocation artifact.

Displacement* (35000) A displacement suit has hologram that projects an image of the wearer a few decimeters away from where she actually is.
The suit is activated by the persona during combat and it increases her armour rating by +75.
Displacement clothing is considered a mercenary artifact.

Jump* (1000) The jump suit maintains a safe gravity for the wearer regardless of what her environment is subjecting her to.
She will be protected from the effects of gravities varying between 0 and 10 g.
If the gravity is being used as an attack on the person she must make a normal (d20) DEX** **attribute** **roll, or be affected the same as everyone else.

Stealth* (500) The stealth suit is the classic sneak suit that is worn by spies, commandos and the like.
The suit absorbs sound around the persona, making her nearly silent.
The stealth suit also absorbs most detection radiations like light, sonar and infrared, making her harder to see in the dark.
In darkness the stealth suit will offer a +20 bonus on sneaky PT rolls.This is considered a spie or nomad or mercenary artifact.

//23) Communicators reworked for helmet in armour
=== Communicators 

// insert table 669

There are several communication transceivers that can be rolled on the Communicator Type Table.
They mainly vary in size, which affects transmission range.
Rarely will a single communicator be rolled, there will usually be several available to ensure the artifact is useful to the expedition.

Each transceiver has a 20% chance of being able to transfer computer data and robot talk.
There is a 5% chance that the device will be a laser communicator, which beams invisible light.
There is a 1% chance that the transmitter will be telepathic.
Telepathic transmitters can chat with any think space within range of the receiver, but the receiver can only transceiver if she also has a telepathic communicator.
If the communications device is telepathic is cannot communicate data or robot talk and precludes it from being a lazer communicator.
The EXPS and Value of each type of communicator is listed below in brackets (EXPS/Value).
If the device is data/bot positive it's value is doubled.
If it is a lazer communicator it's value is doubled.
If it is a telepathic communicator it's value is multiplied 100 times.
Com

include::ROOT:partial$CH48_Table_Communicator_Type.adoc[]

Dental:: (100/300) Dental communicators are very light, no more than 5 gm, and can be capped over one of the persona's molars.
When in the mouth of the persona, she can communicate with her expedition without speaking aloud.
The wearer listens to communicators via vibrations of her skull that are transmitted along the jaw.
These communicators have a 500 meter range, and will number 2 to 12.

Collar:: (25/200) The collar communicators (lapel) are small adhesive transceivers that the persona can attach anywhere.
The collar communicator has range of a 1 kilometer, a wate of 30 gm, and will number 3 to 30.

Wrist:: (25/500) Wrist communicators are larger transceivers that can be worn as a bangles on the wrist, as a huge earring, or as a nose ring.
They have a 12 kilometer range, a 100 gm wate, and will number from 1 to 10.

Handheld:: (25/1000) Handheld communicators are the classic transceivers that one expects to find in police dramas.
These could radios, or cellular telephones, but either way they can communicate amongst each other.
These communicators are slightly programmable, and have multiple channels.
Mechanics can engage in security electronic countermeasures (security scrambling of their signals) with a 4DD maneuver.
These communicators have a 24 kilometer range, a 0.5 kg wate, and will number 1 to 6.

Backpack:: (200/10000) The backpack communicator is a portable radio station.
A mechanic using this radio can engage in electronic countermeasures within the range of the backpack.
This means that a mechanic can use this backpack communicator to camouflage her communications, jam communicators, locate transmissions, and be a general terror on the airwaves.
The referee will decide the DD of such maneuvers.
The backpack communicator will give the any persona a +25 PT roll bonus on communication maneuvers.
The backpack communicator has a planetary range of 100 to 600 kilometers, a wate of 15 kg, and will come with 0 to 9 (d10-1) handheld communicators.

Vehicle:: (400/20000) A vehicle based communicator will allow the persona to engage in virtually any electronic countermeasures (ECM) that she desires, and mechanics will enjoy a +35 bonus on their PT roll when carrying out ECM maneuvers.
The vehicle radio must be powered by a vehicle power plant, or some other power source.
It has a planetary range up to 10000 kilometers, and can also broadcast to space vehicles in orbit.
The communicator has a wate of 65 kg.
The vehicle communicator will be accompanied by 0 to 3  (1d4-1) backpack communicators described in the previous paragraph.

Space Vehicle:: (600/100000)  The space vehicle communicator is a transmissions lab that allows even the most ridiculous planetary ECM maneuvers to be carried out.
The communicator can be used to manipulate voices that have been eavesdropped, to synthesize a new and confusing message.
It is part communicator, part communications computer.
On the planetary side this transceiver can communicate with 0 to 5 (1d6-1)  vehicle communicators, and all the subsidiary communicators that they control.
For instance a space vehicle communicator could monitor, encrypt and manipulate the signals of 4 vehicle communicators, 12 back pack communicators, and 63 handheld communicators.
All of this should be included in the value of the space vehicle communicator.
The communicator has a wate of 200 kg.
It can carry out orbital to planetary communications with ease, and it can communicate with another space vehicle communicator up to 2 to 12 light years away.

== 24) Compass 

// insert table 673

A compass is a direction maintaining device, or anything that attains a constant direction for reference.
This compass will maintain any direction programmed into it, or any of several standard directional indicators.
The compass accounts for any deviations in delineation, gravity, pressure, or climate.
The compass works underwater, in zero gravity, or in a vacuum.
This device will aid a nomad with +24 on any travel oriented PT rolls, and +10 on all her nomadic PT rolls.


== 25) Compukit 

// insert table 674

The compukit is a computerized tool kit that has data sensors in the tools a,pfl other special electronic analyzers.
The compukit is designed to be used by mechanics, and aids them on their performance table rolls (+20 on PT roll, or;
drop 2DD).

=== Computers 

// insert table 677

Computers are black boxes of information that the persona can access.
There are two different types of computers that a persona can get a hold of.
These are vocation computers, and AI computers (artificially intelligent).

==== Vocation Computers 
Vocation computers have a wate of 10 kg, and a technicolor key screen touch display.
They appear to be glorified laptop computers.
They have no print out, and they do not talk.
The persona uses the machine to access information about her profession.
The storage of information is arranged by icons in a haphazard hierarchic manner.
No-one is really certain what information the computer is programmed with, how accurate the information is, or how well the persona will access the information.
It is assumed that the persona will be adding her own information into the vocation computer as she advances in experience levels.

Software can be purchased that will assist the persona with particular tasks.
If a spie were to buy some safecracking software it may allow her to carry out a certain bypass security maneuver without a hitch.
There also might be software that explains how a veterinarian can kill a certain infection.

The vocation computer can only assist the persona on those maneuvers that are technical in nature.
For instance a spie computer may have a list of padlock serial numbers, a few encryption codes, or incomplete instructions on programming a bank machine, but it couldn't assist the persona in martial arts, or stealth maneuvers.
So a mechanic's vocation computer would be useful for virtually all her maneuvers, but a mercenary's vocation computer would be useful for very few maneuvers.

Vocation computers aid the persona in her PT rolls.
Whenever she uses an appropriate vocation computer her PT roll bonus will be a random +3 to 30.
The bonus is always random, but the player can roll once for every 3 levels of experience that her persona has.
Thus a 9th level veterinarian would get 3 rolls on 3d10, taking the highest of the 3 rolls.
To determine the vocation computer type use Table 48.9: Vocation Computer__.__

== 27) Control Baton 

// insert table 679

The control baton is similar in appearance to any marshal's baton, except for two buttons located on the hilt.
One button will completely immobilize a suit of powered armour.
The other will re-mobilize it.
There is a 40% chance that this will work on a specific suit of powered armour.
If the baton does work, the persona within the armour is at the mercy of the baton helder.

The control baton disables the armour wearer's physiological connections to the suit.
Once the persona regains control of her powered armour, in 5 to 50 units.
The armour can be immediately turned off again.
The baton will not allow the armour wearer to come to harm, but once safety is reached the powered armour will become a prison.
E.g., the armour's hover would not shut off, and drop the persona to her death.
The baton has a range of 50 hexes.
A mechanic with a control baton will earn a bonus of +15 when making PT rolls involving powered armour.


== 28) Cords 

// insert table 680

Cords can be used as rope for climbing, tying things down, making macrame, or whatever.
These are special cords, of course, and their values, and wates are listed in the paragraphs following Table 48.12: Cord Type+++<i>+++.
+++</i>+++The value listed is the value per hex of cord, while the EXPS value is the maximum regardless of cord length.
There will be 3 to 300 hexes of cord.

// insert table 681

Alloy* (5/5) Alloy cord is simply stronger than normal cord.
It is lighter and more expensive too.
Alloy cord has a wate of 0.1 kg per hex of length.
The cord can support 750 kg without making any special accommodations.

Grav* (5/200) Anti grav rope can be thrown into the air and it will suspend itself and up to 200 kg of wate.
The grav rope must contact at least one solid surface to function, like the ground, and cannot hover in the air unsupported.
When inactive and being carried, antigrav rope has a wate of 100 gm per hex in length.

Monofilament* (25/150) Monofilament is only a few molecules thick, but all the energy of those molecules are focused on keeping the line together.
The very thin wire is extremely dangerous, and will cut into a persona if it is mishandled.
The line will inflict 2 to 12 hit points of damage if the persona fails a DEX roll while handling it.
Monofilament wire can support 1500 kg in wate without making any special accommodations.

== 29) Cutters 

// insert table 682

Cutters are special cutting devices which can cut through most known substances.
A cutting saw will be able to cut through stone, alloys, or space vehicle hull.
The players should be forewarned that every campaign will have unknown
substances somewhere.
The chance of cutter working on a particular material can be determined by rolling http://expgame.com/?page_id=275sphincter-dice[sphincter dice], as described in Chapter 16: Special rolls.

There are four distinct types of cutters.
All of them include the same safety features that ensures they cannot be used on organic materials.
The lazer cutter will slice through a suit of armour, but leave the persona inside unharmed.
This is a safety precaution for a device that is designed for industry, and not combat.
The cutter type is rolled on Table 48.13: Cutter Type+++<i>+++.
+++</i>+++The cutters cannot be used on unwilling targets.
For example an ambushed robot or suit of powered armour would only get one to hit roll to inflict 3d10 damage, but an incapacitated robot or immobilized powered armour could be cut into shreds.

== 30) Dehydrator 

// insert table 684

The dehydrator is an enormous, and enormously valuable, piece of equipment.
The dehydrator cryogenically suspends an object, and then ejects up to 99.9942% of its unnecessary molecular components.
It also synthesizes a complex memory molecule which can reconstruct the artifact when water is added.
The dehydrator then bags the gray powder in a non-descript cellophane bag.
The finished product will have a random wate between 1 and 10 grams (1d10).
The machine must be attached to a major power plant, and when in use it generates intensity 1-8 radiation in a 10 hex radius.

The dehydrator will safely dehydrate any molecular combination (organic or inorganic) with 99% efficiency.
If something goes wrong with an organic sample it will get 0 to 3 (1d4-1) http://expgame.com/?page_id=366[physical mutations]when rehydrated.
If something goes wrong with and inorganic sample the machine will receive a damage roll (see http://expgame.com/?page_id=286[Chapter 21: Equipment Damage]).
A power failure during dehydration will destroy the specimen in the most disgusting manner possible.
The device can convert up to 750 kg of matter, and then it must cool down for 1 hour per kilogram dehydrated.

//31 detectors
=== Detectors 
// insert table 685

Detectors are classic devices for leading expeditions to excitement, fun, and danger.
All detectors are black boxes, with quite often nothing more than a red light on top, a button on the side, and a grip that ensures its business end is pointed outwards.
The detectors only give a binary answer.
The detectors will yield direction, and degree, but they do not give type, value or any other useful information about the source.

A lie detector, will simply flash red if a lie is detected.
The brightness of the light may depend on the severity of the lie.
The ref should be prepared to be innovative, and have fun with detectors.
Directional detectors, like mineral detectors, will light up more brightly when pointed in the direction of the source.
Movement detectors will display brighter points of light moving above the main red light.

Detectors are 90% efficient.
They will discover the mutant, detect the lie, or find the bomb 90% of the time.
If a detector is used immediately after it fails a detection roll, there is nothing to keep the item from being detected this time around.
Detectors will usually find the closest detectable thing first.
Each use drains 30 units of duration.
For every combat unit the device is on, a unit of energy is drained.

include::ROOT:partial$CH48_Table_Detector_Type.adoc[]

== 32) Detonator Box 

// insert table 687

The long range detonator is used to explode bombs from a safe distance.
Whenever real time detonation, as opposed to a timer, is required a radio beacon is used.
The detonator box uses a radio beacon to set off a detonator which in turn detonates the bomb.
This artifact consists of one detonator box, (the transmitter), and 1-10 detonators.
The detonators have a wate of 1 kg, and must be attached to the bomb.
The detonator box and it's detonators are smart, they will activate any bomb in the manner it needs.
The detonators can explode like a http://expgame.com/?page_id=3378-fragmentation[fragmentation grenade] in their own right.
The detonator box is responsible for 10 detonators, and hopefully the detonators will be properly marked.
If the mercenary pushed a button expecting a bridge to blow up, but a grenade explodes in her backpack instead, it could be deathly embarrassing.
The detonator box offers +15 on PT rolls involving demolitions maneuvers.

== 33) Filters 

// insert table 689

Filters protect the persona's sensory organs from short term hazards.
The filters last for 10 defences, or for 2 years, before deteriorating.
The filters consist of nose plugs, ear plugs, or contact lenses.
The filters allow the the sensor to function normally, but will filter out any damaging effects.
The filter type is rolled on Table 48.16: Filter Type+++<i>+++.
+++</i>+++Each filter is discussed in the following paragraphs.
The EXPS and Value are listed in the brackets.

// insert table 690

Ear Filters* (190/1000) The ear filter sits safely in the ear, and allows normal function of the ear.
The filter changes its structure when subject to any deafening attack.
The spongy ear filter will defend against both the decibels, and the vibrations of sonic attacks of any sort.
A save vs.
mental attack is awarded to completely escape the damage.
The persona's MSTR is doubled when attempting a save versus sonic attack, and this value cannot be less than 16.
The filters will last 2 years in place if unused.

Eye Filter* (350/2000) The eye filter is a contact lens that is flash resistant.
Whenever the eyes are subject to any blinding attack the contact lenses will go opaque and lower the chance of damage to the eyes.
All blinding attacks from flashes, and such, earn 4^,^`ave vs.
mental attack.
If a save is allowed, die wearer's MSTR will be doubled, this value can't be less than 16.
The filters will last 2 years in place if unused.

Nose Filter* (190/1000)  The nose filter allows the persona to shut her mouth, and while breathing through the her nose filter become nearly immune to poisonous gases.
The filters effectively double the persona's CON when saving vs.
respiratory poison gases.
The effective CON cannot be less than 16.
The filters will last 2 years in place if unused.

== 34) Fire Logs 

// insert table 691

Fire logs seem a strange item to have on a high technology equipment list, but these logs are unique.
They are also preserved in the miscellaneous equipment for posterity.
All of the fire log types have a rip cord starter, which ignites them with the pull of a cord.
A roll on Table 48.1 5: Fire Log Type will determine the type of fire log, its duration, and value.

// insert table 692

Wooden* (5) A pull of the rip cord produces 2 hours of colourful flame heat.

Coalex* (10)  A pull of the rip cord releases 8 hours of coal based colourful and warm flame heat.
Coalex is unaffected by all but the most severe meteorological conditions

Glow Pro* (200) The glow pro is a solid cylinder that glows a warm flame coloured light and emits heat to all within a 3 hex radius.
The glow pro can be re-bagged and relit later.
It functions exatmo if necessary, and is good for 5 days continuous burning.

Synthex* (500) The synthex fire log is the stealth heater of the fire log industry.
It gives off no heat signature, or light, and warms all within 4 hexes by emitting interference patterns that vibrate molecules.
This fire log will function in any kind of atmosphere, and will heat the area of effect for 5 days.
If necessary the fire log can be re-bagged and relit later.

== 35) Food Culture 

// insert table 693

A food culture is a polydodecahedron shaped colony of fungus on a stick.
Although it sounds unappetizing the food culture is sanitary, tasty and very nutritious.
The culture can supply a normal (medium sized anthropomorph) persona with the food to survive for 1 day.
The food culture will grow back fully in 6 hours, and be ready for breakfast.
The culture also contains a resource of water within its spongy matrix, supplying the persona's water needs too.
A food culture cannot survive drastic changes in climate.
Moving from one planet to another, and even a drastic biome change may kill the food culture.

== 36) Generator 

// insert table 694

A generator will convert fuel to electrical energy.
The fuel tank of the generator will hold enough fuel to run 100 to 1000 (10d100) batteries worth of power. The generator will only plug into those artifacts with a generator input (those that require a power source), or a http://expgame.com/?page_id=34316-battery-slut[battery slut].
The type of fuel that the generator needs is determined by the referee.
Distilled water is an excellent modern day fuel source.
If a specific fuel type is desired refer to vehicle or space vehicle fuel type.

== 37)_ _Hooks 

// insert table 695

There are two different types of hooks, molecular, and inertia, both of which can support up to 250 kg of wate at one time.
The hooks have handles, and can be used to climb.
They are also aerodynamic and can be fired from a http://expgame.com/?page_id=33927-job-rifle[job rifle] (see chapter 46, Guns).
Once attached the hook is permanent, unless destroyed or immediately detached.
The hook will not detach while supporting a wate in excess of 5 kg.

There is a 42% chance that the hook will be an inertia hook.
The inertia hook will not work in low gravity, but can attach to virtually any horizontal surface (a roof, or ceiling) that it contacts.
If the hook is not an inertia hook it will be a molecular hook.
The molecular hook will attach to almost any (except plastic and ceramic ones) vertical surface that it comes into contact with.

== 38) Instant Stuff 

// insert table 696

Instant stuff is a grey powder that comes in transparent a cellophane-like wrapper.
The labels of which have long since worn off.
Nobody really knows what will be produced when the instant stuff is added to water.
Note that the consequences of mistaking instant stuff for food could be disastrous for a hungry persona.
When water is added to the instant stuff;
a hydrogen oxide attraction reaction (which doesn't exist in our world) is initiated, and the stuff uses the constituent components of these attracted molecules to reconstruct
its former shape.
A roll on Table 48.16: Instant Stuff will yield the type of stuff that will be produced.
See http://expgame.com/?page_id=34330-dehydrator[Dehydrator] in this chapter.


// insert table 697

== 39) Jet Boots 

// insert table 698

Jet boots appear as oversized hiking boots with diminutive jet engines attached to the sides.
The boots are gyroscopically stabilized so that only the most violent of actions will tip the persona over.

The boots move at 21-30 (20+d10) hexes per unit, and when necessary have a handling class equal to half the persona's DEX+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++If the persona is attempting peculiar maneuvers, she may have to make a roll on the driving performance table found in http://expgame.com/?page_id=277[Chapter 17: Driving].
One battery set will last for 5 days of continuous flying.
A persona wearing jet boots cannot attack with non-powered type A weapons.
An activity such as spearing would certainly tip the persona over.
Jet boots do not hover.

== 40) Jet Backpack 

// insert table 700

The jet backpack can carry 30 kg of equipment in its hold, and 150 kg of persona in its straps.
The jet backpack is flown by body movement, and only type C weapons can be used while flying.
The backpack has a maximum speed of between 21 and 40 h/u (20+d20), and can travel continuously for 5 days on one battery set.
If the persona is attempting peculiar maneuvers, she may have to make a roll on the driving performance table found in found in http://expgame.com/?page_id=277[Chapter 17: Driving].


== 41) Joiners 

// insert table 701

Joiners are artifacts which join materials together.
The joiner may be a device, or a substance.
For instance glue, tape and seldering irons are all joiners.
Roll on Table 48.17: Joiner Type to clarify the type of joiner that the artifact is.
Each joiner is discussed in the paragraphs following the table.
Some joiners make permanent joins.
When this occurs it is as though the substances joined were one material since production, and breaking the bond is the same as breaking the solid object.
The bonds of non-permanent joiners are more easily broken.
Such bonds may be broken on a PSTR roll.
The difficulty of the PSTR roll depends more on the strength of the material than on the strength of the bond.

// insert table 702

Sonic* (90/5000) A sonic joiner, or sonic welder, employs acoustic radiation to cause the molecules of substances to intermingle and meld together.
The joiner must contact the substances, and can join things at the rate of 1/2 hex per unit.
The joiner's wate is 4.7 kg, and battery life is 21600 units of joining.
Any mech using this device will earn a +5 bonus on repair PT rolls.

Lazer* (90/7000) A lazer joiner employs focused lazer light to melt substances together.
The joiner has a range of 10 cm, and can join things at the rate of 1 hex per unit.
The joiner's wate is 8.9 kg, and battery life is 21600 units ofjoining.
Any mechanic using this device will earn a +10 bonus on repair PT rolls.

Glue* (100/400) This is the standard instant setting, stick all chemical, it melts the contact points between the substances together.
It can come in a tube, a brush applicator , or an adhesive spray.
The glue requires no setting time, and can be applied in a rush at a rate of 10 cm per unit.
The bond will be a permanent one 10% of the time.
Glue gives a mechanic a +5 PT roll bonus when making repair maneuvers: Mechanics can also make special maneuvers with this glue, like mixing it so that it sets at a predetermined time, or so that it loses its adhesiveness at a later date.
There is a 30% chance that this glue will solely work on organic materials.
This will double its value and give vets a bonus of +5 when doing repair PT rolls.

Tape* (100/250) The tape is super adhesive and saturated with chemicals that melt it into the compound that it is attached to.
Tape is extremely strong, and forms a permanent bond.
Tape can be prepared to set instantly, set at a later date, or lose its adhesiveness at a later date.
Tape is not reusable, and one roll is good for 3 hexes of taping.
Mechs using tape earn a PT roll bonus of +6 when making maneuvers that require attaching things.

== 42) Kirlian Talisman 

// insert table 703

The Kirlian Talisman is a concentration symbol that allows knites, or anti-knites, to be more proficient at their psionic abilities.
A kirlian talisman will give either type of knight +15 on her PT rolls, or ****2DD+++<b>+++, +++</b>+++when practising her abilities.
The kirlian talisman can also be used as a weapon against knites of the opposite caste.
When a knite of one caste throws the talisman at a knite of an opposing caste the talisman can decrease the target's MSTR A thrown talisman can hit a knite, destroying the talisman, and knocking 0-3 points of MSTR off the target.
The mental strength lost is only temporary, and 1 point is returned per 8 hours of sleep,.
While the target's MSTR is less than 18 she cannot use any of her psionic knite abilities.
A kirlian talisman has no value to personas who are not knites, and between knites the talisman are considered invaluable.

== 42) Lazer Pen 

// insert table 704

A lazer pen will burn a crisp black line (of variable width) onto any surface, at any angle in any environment (even a vacuum).
The pen can write on flesh, but will not damage essential organs such as eyes.
The EXPS value of the pen is 2042 for nothings.

== 44) Lights 

// insert table 705

Every light is a normal light with a built in special illumination.
There are several special illumination types covered here.
When used in the normal white light mode the artifact is indistinguishable from a normal flashlight.
Both lighting modes drain batteries equally.
Each light gets one roll on Table 48.20, _Special Illumination._

The normal light will will have a range of 16, 32, 64, or 128 hexes (2 to the power of 3+d4).
This will also be the range of the light's special illumination.
The width of the light beam spreads as it gets further away from the source.
The beam width will be less than a hex wide at the light source, and will increase in width by 1 hex per 16 hexes of range.
Having terminus widths of 1, 2 4, and 8 hexes.
Thus a wall 64 hexes from the light will be lit 2 hex in radius (4 hexes in diameter).

// insert table 707

== 45) Locks 

// insert table 708

Whoever has rolled this item has a lock for their own use.
The device can be attached to whatever the persona desires.
If a spie rolls locks, she may in future earn +20 on her PT roll when attempting to bypass that lock type.
Roll on Table 48.21: Lock Type to determine the lock type and its value.

// insert table 709

== 46) Mapper 

// insert table 710

The acoustic mapper, or lazer mapper, is an aerial device which maps the terrain of a planet, in a very detailed manner.
The mapper cannot penetrate into buildings, but will identify structures that could not have arisen from the planet's normal tectonic development, e.g., buildings, roads, mines, logging, dredging, canals, dams, irrigation, etc.
The acoustic mapper can map one earth sized world before refueling.
The acoustic mapper can plot an earth sized planet in 10 days.
Smaller map sizes are proportionally faster.

== 47) Mindlink 

// insert table 711

The mindlink is a non-powered interface which allows the persona to read information directly from the storage facilities inside computers.
The device also allows her to edit information, and to peruse files.
The larger the computer, the greater the chance she will be able to plug in.
Search, and computation, times are the same as for the regular computer.
The mindlink allows the persona to plug in like an illegal terminal.
The mindlink is different from a http://expgame.com/?page_id=34147-translinker[translinker].
The mind link can only be used to read data, not control a device.
It is essentially a one way data trawler.
When using a mindlink a mechanic will earn a PT bonus of +42 for computer maneuvers.

== 48) Money Counter 

// insert table 712

This is the closest thing to a vocation computer that the nothing could get.
The money counter is a computerized box loaded with heaps of artificial intelligence, and video sensors.
All of which are devoted solely to the counting of money, and estimation of the value of non-technological artifacts.
A money counter is also a safe which can store up to 20 kg of valuable materials.
The machine will grind, chunk, and squeak its way through the evaluation.
When counting currency the device will always get the correct amount, and will identify significantly different forms of currency, which may be counterfeit, or out of date.
The machine has an 80% chance of correctly estimating the value of artifacts.
Correct estimates will be between -9% and +10% (1d20-10) of the actual value of the item.
Incorrect estimates are assigned random values between 1 and 10000 eps.
The money counter is worth 2142 EXPS to nothings.

== 49) Plastix Explosive 

// insert table 714

Plastix explosive is an anti-architectural shape charge.
Each charge is moldable around its prescribed target, and when detonated will blow the shit out of whatever it is pasted to.
The plastic explosive is safe to work with, and can be frozen, or liquified without risk of detonation.
The plastic explosive has no effective range, and the detonating persona can stand directly behind the explosion with no fear of damage (says the manufacturer).

It is generally accepted that 1 kg of plastix will blow a 1 hex sized hole in whatever it is attached to.
Flying debris can be a problem for those caught on the wrong side of a charge (say inside a room).
Technically the plastic explosive will impart 1000 HPS of damage when it is properly applied, and 100 to 600 HPS when not.
If 1000 HPS equals a 1 hex hole, then less damage will produce a proportionally smaller hole.

To properly apply plastic explosive requires a mechanic DD4 maneuver.
Detonation of plastic explosives is easily accomplished, yet virtually impossible to achieve by accident.
There is a 5% chance that the plastique will be silent, doubling its value.
There is also a 15% chance that the plastique will be smokeless, increasing its value by 10%.
Usually 1-8 kg (d8) of plastic explosive will be found.
The EXPS value of a plastix stash is still is 299 regardless of how much is found.

== 50) Psionic Headband 

// insert table 715

The psionic headband helps a persona with her psionic abilities.
The psionic headband wraps around the head, and must lie close to the skin.
This psionic amplifier adds 50% to the persona's MSTR when using her MSTR for mental attack.
For psionic defence the headband will double the persona's MSTR.
The fortified defensive MSTR of the wearer cannot be less than 15.
This is the perfect device for persona's suffering from the mental mutation defect Psionic Defenselessness, in chapter 58, Mental Mutations.
The effects of non-combat mutations are doubled by this artifact.


== 51) Recorders 

// insert table 716

A recorder is any device that records data.
Most recorders in science record things like seismological information, force, temperature, etc.
The types of recorders listed here record audio or video.
The artifact will be a video recorder 42% of the time, otherwise a audio recorder is indicated.

*Audio*:An audio recorder will record any sound radiation that can be picked up by any of the humanoid ears.
An audio recorder can record, play and search for certain sounds.
The device is so accurate that: sonic attacks can be replayed inflicting half their normal damage;
canines will hear recorded noises that humans cannot;
and computers may receive acoustic data transfers.
The recordings can also be replayed and edited.

The complete audio recorder will have a wate of 4.2 kg, and a value of 900.
A smaller less complete version (record only), can be found which has a wate of 140 gm, but must be placed in the larger machine to be played back.
Each large recorder will have 1 to 6 of these portable units.
There are no tapes to be transferred, all of the information is stored in a computer memory, which is limitless.

*Video*:A video recorder records sound and visual images together for a three dimensional moving picture.
The picture can be replayed, edited, and manipulated to a complete finished product.
The video unit's wate is 10 kilograms, and it can support up to 10 (1d10) remote cameras that have a wate of 300 gm each.
The video unit can do anything that an audio unit can do with its audio signals.
A video unit is worth 27 000 plus 1000 per portable camera.


== 52) Robot 

// insert table 718

The player who has rolled this artifact has generated a robot for her persona.
The bot is generated in complete confidence by the referee, and the robot's abilities should only be alluded to when action is necessary.
The robot can be generated as a referee persona robot in  http://expgame.com/?page_id=2193[Subchapter 11-3].
Regardless of what is created the persona is in control of the robot.
The exact robot type should always be kept secret.
A robot should be played more like an amicable referee persona than a slave.
The robot shouldn't be used by the players to upset the balance of the game, and the referee can avoid this by partly role-playing the robot.

== 53) Robotic Override 

// insert table 719

The robotic override is a specialized computer that can reprogram the purpose, and ownership of a target robot.
The device has a range of 10 hexes, and must beam data at its target for 0 to 3 units.
A to hit roll (type C) with the device's transmitting beam must be made each unit of the required time.
At the end of the transmission the bot must win a saving throw versus poison, intensity 3 to 30, or it will be under the control of the persona.

Another version of the robotic override requires only one unit of programming, but a type A attack must be made with a pick like device.
The baton zaps the bot with the programming info, and the bot must save versus poison (intensity 2 to 20), or be controlled.

Either robotic override can have its poison intensity doubled if a DD8 mechanic performance table roll is successful.
All robots get a control factor check every day that they are under control of the device.
If they regain control of their own crazed psyche they must be overridden again by the controlling persona.
Any mechanic with a robotic override will earn a bonus of +20 when working with robots in any capacity.

== 54) Rocket Rollerskates 

// insert table 721

Rocket rollerskates can be used by a persona to skate along the ground at much higher speeds than normal.
The skates have a gyroscopically stabilized truck system which helps prevent crashes and allows for sharper than normal turns.
The rocket roller-skates can only be used in a pair, and need a reasonably smooth surface to function.
A pair of rocket rollerskates have a maximum speed of 31 to 50 h/ u (30+d20), and a handling class equivalent to the wearer's DEX.* *There is a 25% chance that a pair of rocket rollerskates will be a rocket skateboard instead.
If the persona attempts particularly challenging maneuvers she may have to make a check on the Driving Performance table found in Chapter 17: Driving.
Rocket roller skates or a rocket skateboard is a wheel based ground vehicle and does not fly.

=== Scopes 

// insert table 722

A scope is any device which aids a to hit roll.
The scope could be a telescopic sight on a rifle, a gyroscope attached to a sword, or an arm sight for a throwing dagger.
Each scope has a certain to hit roll benefit, and this benefit applies to either type A, type B+++<b>+++, +++</b>+++or type C weapons.
A scope for a type D weapon cannot be used  on a type C attack.
To determine which weapon type the scope works on see Table 48.21: Scope Weapon Type below__.__

Every scope has a to hit roll bonus and a specialization.
The sight uses lazers, sonar, servos and that cue when and how to attack the target.
The to hit bonus is either +30, +60, +90, or +120.
Scope to hit roll bonuses improve the persona's final to hit roll, and go beyond the persona's maximum roll.
This is rolled on 1d4 times 30.
The value of this scope is equal to 1000 per to hit bonus.
E.g., a scope with +90 to hit is worth 90 000.

include::ROOT:partial$CH48_Table_Scope_Weapon_Type.adoc[]

Scope Specialization is used to determine what special bonuses the scope has.
The nature of these effects are described in the paragraphs following the table. The EXPS and Value adjuster are included in brackets

include::ROOT:partial$CH48_Table_Scope_Specialization.adoc[]

Autostrike:: (-500/Value times 10 000) These scopes compensate for virtually any error that the persona can make in combat.
The player still rolls to hit, but a hit is a critical hit, and a miss is a normal hit.
A weapon jam is still a weapon jam, and a therefore a miss.
To hit rolls must still be made to check for critical hits and weapon jams.
It would be considered bad campaign strategy to use an autostrike scope against an expedition.
Yes there is an EXPS penalty for using this scope.

Climate:: (200/Value add 10000)  The climate scope compensates for any meteorological conditions that could make combat more difficult, when using this scope the to hit rolls suffer no penalties for precipitation, fog, sandstorms or reasonable winds.
Combat (200/1000 per bonus point)  A combat scope can be used in the heat of battle to increase

Darkness:: (200/Value at 500) This is a simple night sight that cancels any penalties for darkness.
The scope uses a combination of IR, UV, and whatever else helps the darkened attack.

Gravity:: (200/Value doubled) Computerized stabilizers and gyros balance, and wate, the weapon to, compensate for any changes in gravity.
This scope is also hardened for exatmo and can be used exatmo.

Multiscope:: (total/total times 10) This is a combination of 2-3 (1d2+1) scope specializations built into one scope.
The total to hit roll bonus cannot be greater than +120.
If more than one scope of the same type is present, then +30 on the to hit roll is given for every extra one.
For example, if a multiscope had 3 Darkness sights, it would give +60 to hit in darkness.

Pacifist:: (350/Value add 1 000 000) The pacifist scope is the non-lethal version of the autostrike scope.
It has the ability to determine a target's weak aspects, and turn most any attack into a non-damaging stun attack.
The scope will earn a bonus to hit of +20 to 120 (2d6 times 10), but when it hits it will not score damage.
The pacifist scope will convert the damage into a percent chance to stun the opponent.
Each point of damage inflicted will have a 2% chance of stunning the target for 0 to 9 (1d10-1) units.
The scope can only be used with non-area of effect weapons, like derringers, swords, or full auto rifles.

Range:: (200/Value add 4000) Range scopes increase the range of the weapon.
The range extender scope doubles the weapon's range and halves the decay.
The scope optimizes the projectile's decay by compensating for wind, and gravity effects correctly.
So a weapon that normally has a range of 50 and a -100 to hit per hex beyond its range would have a range of 100 and -50 to hit roll penalty per hex.
For type A weapons the range extender allows them to be thrown like a Type B weapon with a range of PSTR in hexes.


Smoke:: (200/Value add 2000) The smoke cutting scope can sight through mist, fog, smoke, or any other fine particulate debris as if it wasn't there.

== 56) Sincerity Machine 

// insert table 725

The sincerity machine is a sub linguistic vocalization analyzer which modifies the persona's voice such that anything she says sounds nice.
The effect is excellent for negotiation, and increases the persona's CHA by 3 to 8 (d6 + 2).
The sincerity machine can be altered to have a reverse effect which will get the expected reaction.
When combined with good looks, and intelligent wording, even coarse profanities can be accepted as compliments.
A vet will earn a bonus of +15 when doing maneuvers on conscious personas.
This device cannot be used in conjunction with powered armour.

//+++<figure id="attachment_5338" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5338" style="width: 212px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i2.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sonychick.520-212x300.png?resize=212%2C300[Super conductor suit uncovered.,212]](https://i1.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sonychick.520.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5338" class="wp-caption-text">+++Super conductor suit uncovered.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== 57) Superconductor Suit 

// insert table 726

The superconductor suit is a skintight jumpsuit that the persona wears beneath her regular clothes.
If one's figure permits the superconductor suit is rather stylish on it's own.
The superconductor threads are woven with biotransceivers that acceleration the persona's natural dexterity.
The transceivers pick up nerve impulses, and bypass the regular nervous system along superconducting threads.
This allows the persona to react faster, and move faster.
The suit has a DEX bonus of plus 3 to 8 (d6+2).
This device cannot be used in conjunction with powered armour.

Using the device for longer than 1 week at a time will cause the persona to become addicted to the suit.
When it is removed the person will return to her regular DEX, and suffer a 0 to 3 point penalty for 1 to 3 days.
The referee should remember that any damage taken by the persona will also be taken by the superconductor suit.

== 58) Support Equipment 

// insert table 727

Support equipment is any device which cannot be of any use on its own, but is essential to the performance of other useful artifacts.
http://expgame.com/?page_id=357[Chapter]http://expgame.com/?page_id=357[55: Support Equipment] is devoted the cause of resupplying, refueling and repairing artifacts.
If the player has arrived here rolling her start TOYS the support equipment will automatically support one of her present artifacts.
This is just plain nice.
Another twist is to have the support equipment support another persona's artifact.
This gets the players working together from the outset.
The support equipment chapter contains things like batteries, ammo, software and fuel.
Roll on Table 48.25, +++<i>+++Support Equipment +++</i>+++supplied here, and then refer to chapter 60, Support Equipment, for more information.

http://expgame.com/?page_id=357[*Jump to Chapter 55: Support Equipment*]

== 59) Targeting Computer 

// insert table 728

The targeting computer links up the persona's target, chosen through special binoculars, with the attack of an artillery device.
The targeting computer has a 40% chance of being immediately compatible with an artillery piece.
If the artillery is not compatible then the mercenary must make a 10DD maneuver before using the targeting computer.
If the targeting computer is compatible, then it will either maneuver the artillery on a mobile platform, or it will indicate through the binoculars how the artillery should be properly aimed.
Automated targeting is much faster than manual targeting, 1 to 10 units as opposed to the regular 5 to 50 units.
Manual targeting cannot be used on a moving target, but when linked with a targeting computer artillery can take on a moving target.
The targeting computer will give the attacker no bonus to hit, but it will allow personas otherwise untrained to use artillery.
Mercenaries will earn a bonus of +20 on any PT rolls involving artillery when using a targeting computer.

== 60) Tesseract Box 

// insert table 729

A tesseract box is a multi-roomed device which appears much smaller than it actually is.
A tesseract box will only occupy 1 hex in space, while it's relative dimensions can exceed one hundred 3 by 8 hex rooms.
A tesseract box will have 100 to 1000 (d10 times 100) rooms arranged in whatever fashion the referee sees fit.
This paradox is maintained with the manipulation of time and relative dimension sequencing.

A tesseract box can be fitted with a propulsion device.
However only a special drive will be able to move a tesseract box The drives are only taxed with the load of a 1 hex sized box, so incredible distances can be covered by the device.
The drive type can only be a special drive (http://expgame.com/?page_id=351[Chapter 52:Space Vehicles]) located within one of the tesseract box's rooms.
A tesseract box cannot be moved by any external force.

The tesseract box has an incalculable wate, and a pointless value.
The value of a tesseract box is irrelevant, because no owner will part with hers unless she is dead.

The tesseract box is more fancy than science fantasy, but with the correct drive system (a malfunctioning one), a tesseract box can become a source of unlimited adventure.
The best part about a tesseract box is that the expedition must exit it to carry out whatever stupid business they have.
Any items brought into the tesseract box must be brought in through the single exterior opening, and that is a normal sized door.

== 61) Timepieces 

// insert table 730

Timepieces, or watches, are not essential elements of role-playing, but at least once during a campaign, a persona is going to want a good watch.
The watches found here are not just mere timekeepers, but they are calendars, thermometers, and altimeters.
There is a 10% chance of the timepiece being built into another piece of equipment.
Allowing for another roll on the TOY table.
For example the timepiece could be in a rifle.
 The timepieces are self setting, and conveniently adjust themselves to new planetary systems.
After a one day cycle the watch will adjust itself to the new system.
Prolonged exposure to another planetary rotation will also reset the calendar.
All elder chronological cycles can be recalled upon request.
Roll on Table 48.23: Timepiece Type to determine the device's size.
All timepieces have all the same functions regardless of size.
All timepieces can be synchronized for an expedition to work together like they are in a bank heist movie.
If the EXPS value of the timepiece is less that 42 this TOY the referee may choose to allow the player to make an additional roll on the TOY system.

=== Visual Aids 

// insert table 733

The visual aids are a host of goggles that help persona's through darkness, smoke, or worse.
There are 8 visors that have standard effects, and all are listed on Table 48.24: Visual Aid Refer to the following paragraphs for explanations of the visual aids.
Visual aids are often called vizauds or vizaids or optical enhancers or happy goggles.

include::ROOT:partial$CH48_Table_Visual_Aid_Type.adoc[]

Binox:: (75/100) These are electronic binoculars that allow the persona to see further, and with greater detail.
The magnification can be adjusted, and the range of major objects will be given.

Flexiscope:: (75/900)  This device is a flexible light pipe that can be attached to any visual aid, or it can be looked through directly.
The pipe is 50 cm long, 3 cm in diameter, and allows the user to look around corners, through cracks, etc.

Infrared:: (75/290) These goggles allow the persona to see warm things in the dark.

Macroscopic:: (75/2000)  Macroscopic goggles use multiple lenses to allow the persona a 180 degree line of sight.
The goggles are especially good for finding things on open planes, and in outer space.
They are flash protected.
These goggles grant the persona with a +10 on any ambush detection rolls made.

Microscopic:: (75/1000) These glasses are very much like microscopes attached to the eyes.
They allow the persona to zoom in on small areas, and expand the picture several thousand times.
Such goggles give the persona +20 on any PT rolls for delicate maneuvers.

NIX Magic Multi-Vision Visor:: (75/200000)  The NIX corporation makes incredibly complex, and comprehensive equipment.
The multi-vision visor is so detailed that no one really knows how to use it.
All M2V2s will have infrared, binox, and anti-flash screens as standard equipment, but there is also a 17% chance that any needed visual aid will be present, at any given time.
Variable visual aids include smoke cutting, x-ray vision, ultravision, macroscopic, and and microscopic.
The ability may not work the next time it is needed, but it may work the time after that.

Smoke:: (75/250) The smoke cutting visor allows the persona to function as though there was no smoke obscuring her vision.
The scope works equally well with mist, fog, and other particulate matter.
She can still suffocate from the effects of the smoke, but her eyesight won't be hampered while she does.

Ultravision:: (75/500) These goggles allow the persona to see things in the dark.

X-Ray:: (75/15000) The x-ray goggles can be adjusted to see inside things at various depths.
They have a range of 1 hex, and can penetrate up to 1 hex of hull metal.
These goggles are detectable as radioactive by canines.

ZBGs:: (42/50000) The abbreviation G stands for glasses, and ZB are the initials of a universally infamous, cool chicken.
The glasses always appear as normal glasses, but when they detect the kirlian auras of danger they go opaque (yes they will go black if something is behind the persona).
The glasses are special to nothings, and will count as 4242 EXPS.

== 63) Waste Disposer 

// insert table 735

A waste disposer is a completely safe disintegration device (or so the manufacturers say).
Waste is placed into a drawer, the drawer is closed, and the waste is disintegrated with a poofing
noise.
The drawer can handle up to 25 kg of waste at a time.
The disintegrator will open the drawer, and eject any living materials, or moving objects.
The disintegrator harnesses energy released from the previously disintegrated materials.
There will always be just enough energy for the next disintegration.
The waste disposer is designed to disintegrate itself if its casing is tampered with.
