|===

Florian is short for Hominidae Homo Planta.
Florians are humanoid walking plant people.
Florians can take the appearance of any plant type: Venus fly trap, rose, seaweed, pine tree, mushroom, etc.
Remember that these various florian types are only decorations. 
Every florian has two arms, two legs, a torso and a face.
Their skin may be bark, and their hair leaves.
Florians have no abilities other than those listed below.
For example, a poison ivy florian would not be poisonous.

== Photosynthesis
Florians are photosynthetic.  
Even florians modelled after fungi are photosynthetic.  
Florians need sunlight and water to keep from starving.  
Florians do not have blood but life giving sap.
A wounded florian will still bleed to death.

=== Healing
When resting in sunlight and drinking plenty of water the florian can rapidly heal.
A florian will heal twice as fast as other anthro types.
A Sunbathing florian will heal at 2 HPS per day for the first week.
Followed by 4 HPS per day after 7 days. 

The skin of the florian is a doubly important organ.
Fire, heat, cold and corrosive attacks do double damage.


=== Breathing
Florians do have lungs.
Florian lungs draw carbon dioxide from the air and exhale waste oxygen. 
The lungs are redundant and only assist photosynthesis.
florians can hold their breath indefinitely.
This allows florians to be unaffected by inhaled gases.
