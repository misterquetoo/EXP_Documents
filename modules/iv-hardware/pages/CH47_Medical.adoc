[.s3]#Medical equipment is designed to repair organic #[.s4]#machines.
Each piece of medical equipment #[.s5]#performs its own private miracle, but nothing does #[.s6]#everything, and some things do nothing.
Even though the equipment is highly advanced, the #[.s5]#equipment still requires some input from so-called #[.s3]#professionals.
#[.s5]#Veterinarians are the primary users of medical #[.s7]#artifacts, most artifacts merely require a single vet #[.s3]#to point the device correctly, while other devices #[.s8]#need an entire research team.
Biologists can find #[.s4]#some use for the principles of some medical #[.s7]#equipment, and can use them to the benefit of their #[.s3]#PT rolls.
Hopefully, medical equipment will not #[.s7]#only be used to repair the wounded from battle, but #[.s9]#to heal the sick, aid the needy, and other #[.s5]#humanitarian efforts (ha!).
The attributes of medical #equipment are detailed in the following paragraphs.+++<figure id="attachment_5325" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5325" style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i0.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/medicalequipment.467-200x300.png?resize=200%2C300[Medic.

[.s1]#*Combining Equipment*#

[.s3]#As veterinarians gather medical equipment their #[.s7]#proficiency as healers will increase greatly.
In #[.s3]#fact with enough medical equipment a low level veterinarian could perform the most amazing of miracles.
Because of this some referees will want to limit the amount of equipment that he persona #[.s8]#will be able to use at once.
This is entirely the #[.s3]#preference of the referee.
#[.s3]#A vet could be limited to using 2 pieces of #[.s16]#medical equipment per experience level.
If #[.s6]#additional pieces are desired then the persona #[.s3]#must make a successful PT roll to include them.
#[.s6]#Research teams can greatly assist her because #[.s3]#each persona can control several artifacts yet all the players rolling will earn PT roll bonuses.#

== [.s1]#Duration# {.p5}

[.s7]#Duration is the amount of use that can be had from #[.s8]#a piece of medical equipment before it must be #[.s3]#discarded, or its batteries replaced.
#[.s3]#If the duration only has a certain number of #[.s10]#uses like &#8220;One use&#8221;, or &#8220;50 uses&#8221;, then the device is #[.s8]#depleted when that number of uses is reached.
#[.s5]#Many devices only require a freshly charged set of batteries, #[.s7]#but other devices are disposable, or require #[.s6]#replacement materials.
#[.s6]#Devices that have a time length like &#8220;500 #[.s7]#units&#8221;, or &#8220;25 hours&#8221;
can operate for that length of #[.s6]#time before their batteries are depleted.
If a duration lists a wate like 500kgs #[.s7]#This means that the device can process 500 kg of #[.s3]#flesh, or materials, before the batteries must be #replaced.
[.s5]#The last duration type is &#8220;power source&#8221;.
This #[.s6]#means that #[.s11]#ate #[.s6]#artifact requires so much power #[.s8]#that it must be attached  to an industrial power #source, like a nuclear generator, or a hydroelectric power plant.
It is not uncommon for these artifacts [.s12]#to require a cooling down period, or even a #[.s8]#maintenance, between uses.#

== [.s1]#Wate# {.p5}

[.s3]#The wate of medical equipment is the functional #[.s6]#wate of the toy excluding batteries.
For some #[.s3]#equipment the wate after tech level adjustment is #[.s7]#an indicator of how difficult the machine is to use.#

== [.s15]#EXPS# {.p6}

[.s10]#The experience point value is awarded to the #[.s7]#persona who correctly identifies the device, or is #[.s6]#successfully treated with the artifact and then #[.s8]#identifies it.
Enormous experience point awards #[.s5]#are supposed to be granted to entire expeditions, or #[.s8]#research teams, not individual personas.#

== [.s5]#Value# {.p4}

[.s5]#This is the electrum piece value of the device in a regular market, certain devices may be #[.s3]#invaluable if a wealthy enough persona&#8217;s health is on the line.#

== Equipment Type {.p4}

Roll on Table 47.1: Medical Equipment to determine what device the persona has to further the well being of the world.

[table id=586 /]

== 1) Age Determiner {.p4}

[table id=587 /]

[.s19]#This little black box constantly gives the #[.s7]#chronological age of all higher organic creatures #[.s4]#within a three hex range.
The device can be #[.s6]#adjusted to determine the age of microbes and #[.s5]#other organic life forms.
The age determiner can be #used to help detect a disguise, notice a time space [.s3]#aberration, or assist in any research that requires tissue growth or culture maintenance.
#One set of batteries lasts for about five years.

== 2) Anesthetics Mask {.p14}

[table id=588 /]

[.s3]#An anesthetics mask looks like a gas mask with #[.s7]#various dials and indicators.
The mask will render #[.s3]#any organic mammal unconscious for the time set #[.s8]#on the mask.
This is a pain free state similar to #[.s16]#being maintained under general anesthetic, #[.s7]#however no pharmacological agents are employed.
#[.s3]#It is virtually impossible to subject an unwilling patient to the anesthetics mask.
Once employed #[.s8]#there is absolutely no saving throw granted.#

[.s5]#The mask should not be prematurely removed #[.s7]#from the subject.
If the creature is not returned to #[.s3]#consciousness by the mask, there is a 2% chance that unconsciousness will persist for 1-100 days.
The mask can only anesthetize one creature at a #[.s5]#time.
The mask will offer a +20 bonus to any PT roll #[.s3]#that requires a stable unconscious patient.
One set #[.s6]#of batteries will anesthetize for a total of 300 #[.s7]#minutes (5 hours).
#

== [.s20]#3) Anti Aging Beam# {.p4}

[table id=589 /]

[.s10]#This machine bastes the creature with information encoded energy that has a chance of reprogramming #[.s3]#aging cells in the body.
The subject must lie in the 1 meter x 2 meter treatment rectangle one hour a day for three consecutive days.
The player must #[.s10]#make a successful recovery roll to have her persona #[.s3]#receive the effects of this device.
The beam can #[.s6]#eliminate any unnatural aging that the persona #[.s8]#has been subject to.
For instance, aging due to #[.s7]#chrono attack weapons, or special drive accidents #[.s3]#could be healed by the anti-aging beam.#

[.s10]#The effect of the beam is to reduce the cellular #[.s3]#age of the persona by 3 to 30 years per treatment.
The de-aging of the body&#8217;s cells will not heal any #[.s7]#lost attributes, but it will reduce the persona&#8217;s age.
For instance if a persona were 52 years of age and #[.s10]#she had suffered #[.s1]#PSTR #[.s10]#and #[.s1]#DEX #[.s10]#penalties for aging she could decrease her age by 3 to 30 years, but this #[.s6]#would not restore her lost attribute points.
To #[.s3]#restore lost attributes the persona must employ a rejuv chamber.
The value of the anti-aging treatment is that she will require #[.s6]#3 to 30 more years of aging to reach the same #[.s7]#attribute decay level again.
See chapter 13, Health.#

[.s3]#The amount of aging is always random, and can only be adjusted if a veterinarian makes a PT of 1 year adjustment per 2 DD.
For a vet persona #[.s5]#to reduce the amount of de-aging by 5 years would #[.s8]#require a 10DD maneuver.
If the persona should #be aged below 1 year, she is dead.
Since the amount of de-aging acquired by the cells is usually random [.s3]#then this device could easily kill a frequent user.
The anti-aging beam could be used to age a target if a veterinarian were to adjust it accordingly (10 DD at least).#

== [.s21]#4) Anti Mutation Beam# {.p27}

[table id=590 /]

[.s17]#An anti-mutation beam (A.M.B.) can cause mutated #[.s5]#cells (or groups of cells) to restructure themselves #[.s7]#into their original biological forms.
If the beam #[.s22]#were pointed at a mutant with the physical mutation #[.s5]#arms, the arms would fall off as the beam hit her.
#[.s10]#This would work the same for beneficial mutations also, antennae would shrivel up, and a symbiotic #[.s5]#attachment would curl up and fall off.
A mental #[.s7]#mutation would simply stop working.
Thus the #[.s10]#anti-mutation beam is as much a defence against #[.s7]#mutants, as it is a cure for defective mutations.#

[.s6]#Not all mutations are obviously genetic #anomalies, and some merely represent extreme [.s10]#variations of normality.
If there is a dispute brewing #[.s19]#over whether the anti-mutation beam is #[.s10]#appropriate, or not, consult the http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#sphincter-dice[sphincter dice], as #described in chapter 16, Special Rolls.

The beam will be effective if the mutant fails [.s7]#a poison attack against her physical mutations, #[.s5]#and psionic attack against her mental mutations.
#The attack intensity of the A.M.B.
is 2 to 12 plus [.s10]#one per level of veterinarian using the device.
The total body wate of the patient is considered when #[.s22]#treating for mutations, and the device can eliminate #[.s17]#mutations from 100 kg of flesh per battery set.
The #[.s16]#beam has a 40 cm range, and its effect is #[.s7]#instantaneous.#

[.s3]#If a veterinarian wishes to only eliminate #[.s8]#certain mutations she can cover parts of the #[.s7]#mutant&#8217;s body, and focus the beam.
To avoid a #[.s8]#specific mutation requires 3DD per physical #mutation, and 10DD per mental mutation.
If the [.s10]#vet wanted to eliminate a mutant&#8217;s pus producing #organ, while retaining her symbiotic attachment [.s3]#and pyrokinesis the vet would have to make a #[.s5]#13DD maneuver.#

== 5) Anti Virus Beam {.p4}

[table id=591 /]

[.s17]#The hand held anti-virus beam will kill any foreign virus, bacteria, fungi, prion or organism that is found infiltrating #[.s10]#an organic substance.
The beam will not kill those #[.s1]#organisms which are determined to be in a symbiotic #[.s5]#relationship with the patient.
This super-sterilizer #has a range of 75 cm.

[.s7]#There is a larger version which weighs 10 #[.s5]#times as much, is worth 125000, and is effective on #[.s10]#all micro-organisms within a 2 hex radius of effect.
The Sterilizer will be found 20% of the time.
#[.s7]#Both sizes have a battery life of 200 units.
This #[.s10]#artifact will give a veterinarian +10 on her PT roll #[.s5]#when dealing with open wounds, and countering #infections.

== 6) Auto Tourniquet {.p4}

[table id=592 /]

[.s10]#An automatic tourniquet can be wrapped over or near any major source of blood loss.
The tourniquet #[.s8]#is more than just an automated constricting #[.s7]#bandage, and it employs electrical impulses to #[.s22]#constrict and dilate appropriate blood vessels . Once #activated, the auto tourniquet will eliminate [.s3]#damaging effects caused by blood loss.
#[.s17]#The tourniquet will function on a severely damaged #[.s5]#limb, an internal bleed, or a head wound.
If the #tourniquet is improperly placed (e.g., around an anthro[.s7]#&#8216;s neck) safety mechanisms will ensure #[.s10]#that it disconnects itself.
The auto tourniquet #[.s5]#will not heal damage, but it will prevent further #[.s8]#damage.
The electric tourniquet will always #[.s5]#function (no batteries necessary) if attached to a #[.s10]#warm organic creature.
Veterinarians earn +20 on #any PT rolls that involve blood loss (surgery to severe trauma).+++<figure id="attachment_5326" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5326" style="width: 245px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i2.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/medicalthing.471.png?resize=245%2C183[Staples, sutures, bandages.

== 7) Bandage Box {.p34}

[table id=593 /]

[.s10]#This medical device is more than just a collection of #bandages and plasters.
A bandage box will quickly [.s7]#crawl all over the patient&#8217;s body and sew, or glue, #together any open wounds that it finds.
It will also [.s3]#sterilize and redress any old wounds.
A bandage #[.s10]#box will take 1-6 minutes to sew up a medium sized #[.s7]#patient (anthropomorph sized).
A battery set will #provide power for 75 minutes of search-and-sew.
A [.s7]#vet will earn a bonus of +15 on quick fix PT rolls #[.s3]#when using a bandage box, and a bonus of +5 on any surgery PT rolls.#

== [.s5]#8) Biorganic Attachment# {.p5}

[table id=594 /]

[.s7]#A biorganic attachment is a ready to affix limb.
It #[.s6]#may be from an organ donor bank, from some #biological vat, or from a dissected clone, but either [.s3]#way the limb has been prepared for attachment to #[.s5]#a host body.
The limb in a bag has all the energy sources, computer technology and invasive devices built into it.
A biorganic attachment will nearly replace itself in a gory noisey automated surgical procedure.
Once attached be biorganic attachment #[.s6]#will become seamless with the persona.
If the #[.s7]#persona is physically strong the attachment will quickly grow #[.s3]#in strength.
If the persona is weak and sickly the #[.s8]#attachment will quickly atrophy.
#[.s3]#Biorganic attachments are relatively easy for #[.s8]#a veterinarian, or a biologist to attach.
Requiring #[.s4]#a 4DD maneuver for success.
#[.s4]#There are #[.s3]#several types of biorganic attachments, and these types are determined on Table 47.2:__ __Attachment Style__.__#

[table id=595 /]

[.s33]#*1) Basic Unit*:#[.s8]# Requires a veterinarian for proper attachment.
It only requires a DD4 maneuver.
Reasons for failure could be wrong size of patient, or poor technique#[.s7]#.
[.s8]#Sizing and limb type is determined by the #[.s5]#the http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#sphincter-dice[sphincter dice].
#The basic unit is also limited to type of limb that needs replacing.
The #[.s3]#limb can be saved for later use on another persona #[.s8]#if the attempt fails.
EXPS 2000.
Value 750 000.#

[.s28]#*2) Special Edition*:#[.s7]#This unit is self attaching and is not affected by limb type or size of the patient.
A vet can attach the limb as a DD1 maneuver, or the personas could let t#[.s6]#he self #[.s12]#attaching unit do its own thing.
The special edition can#[.s3]# attach itself with #[.s7]#90% accuracy (a 90% chance of success).
Failure of the attachment is left up to the referee.
EXPS 1000.
Value 1 500 000.#

[.s33]#*3) Luxury Edition*:#[.s8]#This sausage-in-a-bag can #[.s3]#attach itself regardless of race, or size, and may #[.s7]#replace any external body part that is not an organ.
A luxury edition biorganic attachment can replace #[.s5]#fins, wings, noses, trunkS;
ears, eyelids, or external #[.s8]#mutations.
It requires no medical attention, and #[.s7]#has a 99% chance of success.
EXPS 750.
Value 2 750 000.#

*4) Luxury Plus*: Same as the luxury edition but also has a physical mutation attached to it.
The physical mutation cannot be a defect, and must be appropriate or explainable by the referee.
EXPS 750.
Value 2 750 000.

== [.s36]#9) Biorganic Replacement# {.p4}

[table id=596 /]

[.s4]#Biorganic replacements are ready to implant #[.s3]#organs, tissues, or glands.
They can be straight from tissue culture vats, harvested from clones, #[.s4]#harvested from criminals, or cybernetically #[.s3]#designed.
The biorganic replacement can be used to enhance an existing system, or to replace an #[.s9]#ailing one.
The nature of each biorganic #[.s19]#replacement is discussed in the following #[.s8]#paragraphs, as is its value and attribute bonus.
[.s5]#The replacement type is rolled on Table 47.3: #[.s3]#Replacement Type__.__##

[.s5]#For any biorganic attachment to work, the vet #[.s3]#must properly implant it using surgery.
This has #[.s5]#base difficulty of 15DD.
The process of biorganic replacement will take 1 to 6 hours, and the persona #must be unconscious, yet alive, for the entire time.
[.s10]#The referee is encouraged to modify the DD of this #[.s4]#maneuver to each replacement type and the #[.s8]#circumstances surrounding the operation.#

[.s5]#For instance if a biorganic replace were being #[.s7]#used to replace the sight of a blinded persona then the referee should ensure an almost certain chance #[.s5]#for surgery success and tissu#[.s38]#e #[.s5]#e acceptance.
If the #[.s10]#replacement is being used for enhancement of fully #[.s7]#functional eyes then the chance for success should #be reduced.

[.s7]#If the biorganic replacements are being abused #[.s3]#to build super personas then the referee should #[.s7]#increase the chances of failure, and inflict some of #[.s5]#her own side effects.
For instance too many muscle #[.s7]#grafts may result in tissue rejection that includes #[.s10]#previous implants and some of the patient&#8217;s original #tissue, leaving her with a [.s39]#PSTR #that is less than she began with.

[table id=597 /]

[.s34]#*1) Blood Filters* (150000):#[.s3]#These will assist, or #[.s5]#replace, the body&#8217;s present organs for cleansing the #[.s8]#blood.
If the replacement is added to a persona #[.s7]#with a fully functioning system she would improve #[.s3]#her CON attribute by 10% (adjustment cannot be #[.s18]#less than +1, nor greater than +2), and earn a #[.s3]#bonus of +2 when making saving throws against poison attacks.#

[.s34]#[.s35]#*2) Bone Hardening* (100000):#[.s18]#This persona&#8217;s bones have been treated with microbiological #[.s8]#cultures that will lay down a hardening laminate #[.s5]#on all of her bones.
This can only be done on those #[.s4]#personas that are at least adult in age.
When #[.s7]#applied to normal strength bones, the persona will #[.s19]#earn a HPS maximum bonus of 20%.
Bone #[.s3]#hardening cannot be over laid.##

[.s41]#*3) Brain Tissue* (1000000):#[.s16]#This treatment #[.s8]#involves the insertion of additional brain tissue #[.s4]#which will give the patient improved mental #[.s3]#capacity and memory retrieval.
When installed in a fully functioning system she would improve her INT attribute by 10% (adjustment cannot be less #[.s5]#than +1, nor greater than +2).
There is a cumulative #[.s8]#15% chance per implant that something will go #wrong.
Initial implants will involve mild insanities, [.s8]#and later implants may involve severe insanities.
#[.s7]#If the persona is #[.s42]#abusing brain #[.s7]#tissue implants she #[.s5]#may find herself comp &big with other thinkspaces #for control of her body.

[.s43]#*4) Conductive Tissue* (500000):#[.s4]#Conductive #[.s7]#tissue involves the implantation tissue that grows #[.s3]#alongside motor neurons producing wider, lower #[.s7]#resistance neural pathways.
These allow for faster #[.s18]#reaction times and improved dexterity.
When #installed in a fully functioning nervous system the [.s7]#patient would improve her DEX attribute by 10% #[.s8]#(adjustment cannot be less than +1, nor greater #[.s7]#than +2).
The implants will also offer an initiative #[.s10]#roll bonus of +2.#

[.s43]#*5) Contractile Tissue* (100000):#[.s4]#Contractile #[.s8]#tissue biorganic replacements are muscle tissue #[.s4]#plus the necessary neural wiring to make the implants useful.
The muscle can improve the #patient&#8217;s PSTR attribute by 10% (adjustment cannot [.s3]#be less than +1, nor greater than +2).
For every 3 #[.s3]#points of PSTR increase, representing several muscle grafts, the patient will suffer a -2 DEX #[.s7]#penalty, as her fine motor system gets confused amidst the additional tissue.#

[.s44]#*6) Covering, Encasement* (50000):# [.s8]#This is an #[.s3]#exatmo hardened body glove that is surgically #[.s9]#integrated with the patient.
Once she is #[.s10]#permanently inserted into her new skin she will be #[.s3]#unaffected by exatmo pressures, any airborne #[.s5]#contact toxins, and her natural armour rating will #[.s17]#be 550.
The patient will also suffer a -5 CHA penalty #[.s5]#and a -2 DEX penalty.
All of the mutant&#8217;s orifices can be voluntarily sealed, connected to air sources, #or whatever.

[.s45]#*7) Covering, Hardening* (10000):# [.s3]#A hardened #skin covering involves the plating of the mutant&#8217;s [.s10]#fat pads, force absorbent inserts, and shock absorbent head moldings.
The persona suffers a CHA penalty of-2, but enjoys an improved armour rating of +80, #[.s17]#and a 10% bonus on her HPS maximum.
Covering #hardening can only be done once.

[.s41]#*8) Digestion* (55000):# [.s47]#This biorganic #[.s48]#replacement can be used to place any #[.s10]#malfunctioning organ associated with the digestive tract.
This includes teeth, stomach, intestine, and #[.s3]#related organs.
If this system is inserted into a #[.s17]#fully functioning patient it will allow her to chew on #[.s10]#peculiar items, and consume them without gastric despair.
This patient would earn a bonus of +5 on #[.s7]#saves versus ingested poisons.#

[.s49]#*9) Heart, Pump* (200000):# [.s10]#The vital juices pump #replacement can replace an ailing heart, or it can [.s17]#be used to supercharge a fully functioning one.
The #[.s10]#additional heart tissue will improve the persona&#8217;s CON by 10% (improvement cannot be less than +1, #and cannot exceed +2).

[.s50]#*10) Lung* (200000):# [.s7]#The additional respiratory tissue is not limited to lung, but can be gills for #[.s17]#aquarians, or green leafy material for florians.
The #[.s10]#respiratory tissue will allow healthy individuals to #[.s22]#improve their CON by 10% (improvement cannot be #[.s10]#less than +1, and cannot exceed +2).
They will also #[.s7]#earn a bonus of +2 on saves versus respiratory #[.s17]#poisons, and will[.Apple-converted-space]#  #be able-hold their breath twice as #long as normal.

[.s51]#*11) Mental Mutation Insert* (10000000):# [.s5]#This is a very bizarre biorganic replacement indeed.
The #[.s3]#operation will insert a single mutation that is #[.s8]#determined on the Mental Mutation table in #[.s10]#chapter 58.
It is not recommended to insert a defect #at such great economic expense.

[.s52]#*12) Physical Mutation Insert* (5000000):# [.s12]#A #[.s5]#physical mutation attachment will be determined #[.s3]#by the +++<i>+++Physical Mutation +++</i>+++table in chapter 59.
#[.s17]#Defects are not to be inserted unless the referee has #[.s3]#some how justified the penalty as part of her #ongoing campaign.

[.s49]#*13) Sensory, Audio* (2000000):# [.s10]#Audio biorganic replacements can be used to bypass damaged audio #[.s7]#sensors, or to enhance undamaged ears.
If the #[.s3]#biorganic replacement is used to enhance the #[.s10]#patient&#8217;s hearing she will earn a bonus of 10% on her AWE attribute.
This bonus cannot be less than #[.s17]#+1 and cannot be greater than +2.
Enhanced audio #[.s5]#sensors will double the persona&#8217;s chance to detect #an ambush.

[.s51]#*14) Sensory, Visual* (3000000):# [.s5]#The optical bior#[.s10]#ganic replacement can be used to cure blindness, or #[.s5]#it can be used to enhance a fully functional set of #[.s10]#eyes.
The patient&#8217;s AWE will be increased by 10%, #[.s5]#this bonus cannot be less than +1 and cannot be #greater than +2.

[.s28]#*15) Sensory, Touch* (2500060):# [.s53]#The touch sensory #[.s7]#system can be used to repair any defect in the #[.s3]#patient&#8217;s tactile senses.
If the patient&#8217;s touch #[.s10]#sensors are fully intact this biorganic replacement #[.s1]#can be used to enhance her DEX by 10%.
The bonus #[.s22]#cannot be less than +1, and not greater than +2.
An #enhanced tactile system will offer the patient +10 [.s5]#in any eye hand co-ordination PT rolls.#

[.s45]#*16) Sensory, Taste/Smell* (100000):# [.s3]#If the biorganic re#[.s17]#placement is used to enhance the persona&#8217;s normal #[.s10]#sense of smell, it will offer a +10% bonus on her #[.s22]#AWE, and this bonus cannot be less than +1 and no #[.s17]#greater than +2.
The persona can use this enhanced #[.s3]#sense of smell to better detect ambushes.
Her #[.s10]#ambush detection ability will be doubled with this #enhancement.

== 10) Blind Goggles

[table id=598 /]

[.s3]#Blind goggles will restore sight to any humanoid #[.s4]#creatures that suffers visual impairment.
The #[.s5]#goggles can in no way enhance regular vision.
This #[.s7]#device can only restore sight up to a range of 1 hex per point of adjusted AWE (AWE#[.s55]#* *#[.s7]#plus level).
This #[.s3]#distance is halved in darkness.
The goggles will #[.s8]#only restore regular sight and cannot reproduce #[.s3]#any special optical abilities the persona may have #[.s8]#had.
One battery set will operate for 12 months.#

== 11) Blood Clot Disruptor {.p31}

[table id=599 /]

[.s8]#This device can be used by any veterinarian to #[.s3]#destroy build-ups of organic material that inhibit the flow of blood through normal channels.
If the #[.s7]#vet succeeds with this DD3 maneuver, clotting can #[.s3]#be disrupted in any of the anthro types.
#[.s5]#Once the location of a clot is determined, it can #[.s6]#be disrupted in 1-3 units.
There is a standard, #[.s3]#whole body 15-unit treatment that will eliminate #[.s5]#99% of malignant clots in the body.
The blood clot #[.s7]#disrupter will assist the any persona with a +10 PT #[.s3]#roll bonus for any blood flow related activities.#

[.s5]#If this device is being used as a weapon, it will #[.s7]#have unpredictable effectiveness.
Each attack will #[.s8]#drain 30 units of battery power.
The blood clot disrupter&#8217;s maximum effective range is 2 hexes, #and it attacks as a Type C weapon.
The device will [.s3]#inflict 2 to 12 hit points in hemorrhage damage.
#[.s7]#After each attack there is a 1% chance per hit point of damage inflicted of the the target developing a #[.s3]#major internal bleed.
A major internal bleed will inflict 5 to 50 hit points in damage.#

== 12) Blood Congelator {.p4}

[table id=600 /]

[.s10]#A Blood congelator causes the blood to thicken, to #produce scabs, and control undesired blood flow.
External bleeding, or blood drain, may be stopped, [.s7]#95% of the time, within 1-10 units.
Only a vet can #[.s5]#use a Blood Congelator to control internal bleeding.
#[.s3]#To control internal bleeding is a DD3 maneuver #[.s7]#with a blood conge#[.s7]#later.
When combatting blood #[.s3]#loss the vet will earn +20 on her PT roll.#

[.s3]#When this device is being used as a weapon, #it has a 2 hex range and attacks as a type C weapon.
[.s5]#If a hit is scored it will inflict 2 to 12 hit points of #damage.
Each attack will cost 200 units of battery [.s7]#drain.
For each hit point of damage inflicted there is a 1% chance of target developing an embolism.
#[.s6]#An embolism will inflict 5 to 50 hit points in #[.s3]#damage 1 to 4 days later.
The damage inflicted #[.s56]#cannot be healed by regeneration, or #[.s3]#pharmaceuticals, unless the target is also treated #[.s12]#with a Blood Clot Disrupter, or anti#[.s3]#coagulants.
The damage can be healed naturally #[.s7]#by the target, but accelerated healing will not function.#

== 13) Bone Setter {.p30}

[table id=601 /]

[.s5]#The Bone Setter can heal major bones or groups of #[.s3]#bones of most conceivable ailments.
Fractures, #[.s7]#cavities, cancers, deformities, and bone-ligament #[.s5]#damage maybe magically repaired with this device.
#[.s18]#The Bone Setter has no effect on Florians or #[.s3]#insectoids for obvious reasons.
A treatment takes #1-10 minutes of a 90 minute battery charge.
Bone [.s5]#repairing can account for 1 to 6 extra hit points of #[.s8]#healing every week.
This instrument will work #[.s7]#90% of the time.
When using a bone setter the vet #[.s6]#will earn a bonus of +10 on her PT roll when treating traumatic injuries.#

== 14) Breath Ball {.p79}

[table id=602 /]

[.s7]#A Breath Ball is a chemical respiration doo-hickey #[.s3]#that has two principal uses.
The first use is when the ball is held in the mouth.
In this state it will slowly dissolve, and produce 15 minutes of air for an anthro.
Sucking on a breath ball will #[.s5]#help the persona avoid a malicious, or inhospitable, #[.s8]#atmosphere.#

[.s3]#The breath ball can also restore the breathing of a non-respiring anthro.
If forced into #[.s4]#the stomach, the ball will proceed to induce #[.s3]#muscular contractions that will imitate respiration #for 10 minutes.
During this time, it will repair any [.s3]#damage done by poisons to the lungs.
The breath #[.s8]#ball can counteract any poison of intensity less #than the ball&#8217;s Tech Level.
Note that only poisoned [.s3]#lungs may be repaired (gases).
The persona will #[.s5]#regain normal respiration if she makes a successful #[.s3]#damage system shock roll.#

== 15) Cardio Vest {.p4}

[table id=603 /]

[.s10]#This vest, worn over the torso (like most vests), will #[.s7]#regulate and monitor a heart beat for an indefinite period.
It can also restore a lost heart beat by using up 1 hour&#8217;s battery supply.
Any persona requiring #massive heart stimulation such as this will lose [.s3]#consciousness, and must make a recovery roll for this procedure to work.#[.s8]#Once the heart has been resuscitated, it can #[.s6]#be kept beating artificially by the vest for the #[.s8]#duration of its battery supply.
The persona will #[.s19]#remain unconscious during artificial heart #[.s9]#stimulation._ When using a cardio vest a #[.s12]#veterinarian has a +25 bonus when making #[.s6]#resuscitation PT rolls.
Note that a Cardio Vest #[.s3]#cannot keep the brain alive unless the lungs are #[.s7]#operating.
The vest has 30 hours of battery supply.
#

== [.s20]#16) Cerebro Converter# {.p14}

[table id=604 /]

[.s5]#A cerebro converter can analyze an organic storage #[.s3]#device (like a brain), convert the information to #[.s6]#electrical signals, and then reprogram another #[.s16]#brain with the converted information.
Both think spaces are permanently altered by the #[.s3]#procedure.
The medical significance of this device #[.s10]#is profound, and it can be used to switch a think space #[.s18]#from one brain to another.
This device has an #[.s6]#insidious nature, and some of its uses include #[.s8]#complete brainwashing, ultimate disguises, and think space immortality.#

[.s5]#One example of a cerebro conversion could be #[.s3]#transfer of the emotions, knowledge and mental #[.s18]#strength of the the donor into the #[.s3]#receiver.
This will leave the donor body a mind #[.s8]#blanked husk, and will obliterate the receiver&#8217;s #[.s7]#think space and personality.
The donor think space would now have the persona type#[.s10]#, #[.s13]#AWE#*[.s13]#, #*[.s13]#CHA#*[.s13]#, #*[.s13]#CON#*[.s13]#, #*[.s13]#DEX#*[.s13]#, #*[.s10]#INT, #[.s13]#PSTR+++<b>+++, +++</b>+++#[.s10]#and Hps #[.s5]#max of the receiver, and the memories, personality, think space, MSTR, class and experience level of the #[.s8]#donor.
Essentially the receiver body becomes the donor and the donor body becomes a husk#[.s7]#.
There is no possibility of partial #[.s3]#knowledge transfer, unless combined with other #equipment.

[.s3]#Danger: Such maneuvers are not without risk.
It must #[.s7]#be emphasized that this is a very dangerous device #[.s6]#for both the personas, and the referee.
For the #[.s7]#personas, there is a high chance of death, insanity, and mental loss.
The users must be aware that the #[.s16]#cerebro converter is indiscriminate, and all #[.s8]#knowledge (family life, loves, hates, gossip) is #[.s4]#transferred into the receiving brain.
This can #[.s6]#cause an infinity of problems, and if properly exploited by the referee can create an endless #source of fun.
[.s7]#Any procedure failure, like a power failure, interruption by combat, or #a failed performance table roll will result in a side [.s3]#effect.
The side effect is generated on Table 47.4: Cerebro Side Effect#_._

[.s3]#*Failure*: Even if the veterinarian makes a stunning PT #[.s12]#roll there is still a chance that there will be #[.s6]#unpreventable think space confusion.
The base #[.s7]#chance for success of the cerebro conversion is the #[.s3]#ratio between the receiver&#8217;s INT and the donor&#8217;s #[.s5]#combined INT and #[.s60]#MSTR+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++#[.s5]#Even if this ratio is over 100%, there is still a 15% chance of side effects (less #[.s7]#1% per Tech Level of the cerebro converter).#

[.s4]#*More Failure*: If a think space were being moved from a #[.s18]#persona with a 12 INT#[.s61]#* *#[.s18]#and a 9 MSTR#[.s62]#+++<b>+++, +++</b>+++#[.s18]#and this #[.s3]#think space were being copied over the think space #[.s7]#of a persona with a 16 INT#[.s42]#* *#[.s7]#there would be a (16 / 21 = ) 76%  chance of the cerebro conversion being #[.s4]#successful.
Artificially preserved brains, and #[.s8]#mechanical-electrical devices are considered to #have an INT of 25, but no [.s63]#MSTR**.**#

*[.s7]#Chance for Conversion Success#*

*[.s10]#(INT of receiver)/(INT+MSTR of donor)#*

[.s3]#If the process fails for any reason at all there #[.s7]#is a 25% chance (less 1% per tech level), that the #[.s3]#machine will suffer a breakdown.
The severity of the breakdown is rolled on the Extent of Damage #[.s64]#table in http://expgame.com/?page_id=286[Chapter 21: Equipment Damage].
#[.s7]#Regardless of maintenance problems, the cerebro converter must cool down for 1 hour per point of donor&#8217;s INT before being used again.#

[.s7]#*Even More Failure*: Many of the cerebro conversion side effects involve competition between the two think spaces involved #[.s3]#in cerebro conversion.
The state of the think space is radically altered for conversion into the other #[.s10]#brain, and this has a great equalizing effect on both #[.s7]#think spaces.
If there is a great discrepancy between #the combating MSTRs[.s63]#* *#then the referee must adjust [.s7]#them both so that there is a reasonable chance of #[.s18]#success for either attacker.
This can be most #[.s7]#objectively done by averaging the two #[.s67]#MSTRs**.**#

[table id=605 /]

[.s43]#*1) Insanity*:#[.s4]#Both think spaces connected by the cerebro converter are locked in a battle for control#[.s18]#.
First the donor think space attacks the receiving #[.s7]#think space (comparing their MSTRs), and then vice versa.
The referee could use either a pair of http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#saving-throw[saving throws], or an http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#attribute-competition-rolls[attribute challenge] using MSTR.
If the #[.s3]#attack is successful, refer to the http://expgame.com/?page_id=257#insane[Insanity Tables] listed in chapter #[.s68]#11+++<b>+++, +++</b>+++#[.s3]#Referee Personas.
Machines and robots will use their intelligence against the attack, and will suffer what ever insanity #[.s6]#that is generated.#

[.s34]#*2) Mind Blank*:#[.s3]#This is another pair of psionic #[.s7]#attacks that the two think spaces will automatically #make against each other.
Failure to save will cause [.s6]#result in the storage system to be blanked.
This #[.s8]#can apply to any storage format attached to the #[.s5]#cerebro converter, whether biological or mechanical.
#[.s3]#All data banks, levels of experience, memories, #skills, etc.
will be wiped clean from a brain that has [.s8]#been blanked.
It is up to the referee whether this is permanent or not.
If the expedition is up to no good, make the persona start from scratch with the attributes they presently have.
If the expedition is trying to save the universe then have the amnestic fugue last an amusing amount of time.
#

[.s34]#*3) Dominance*:#[.s3]#Dominance is confusing a confusing mix of two think spaces.[.s8]#is as if one #think space has been copied into the other, without [.s3]#erasing the preceding one.
#This will truly call on the improvisational talents of the referee.
The #[.s16]#receiver could be dominated by the donor&#8217;s #[.s8]#transplanted mind, or vice versa.
#[.s3]#The more intelligent #brain will usually manage to preserve itself.
If the [.s8]#think spaces are of equal intelligence, the minds #[.s7]#may be switched.
Don&#8217;t omit the possibility that a #[.s16]#organic creature may become a robot if her #[.s8]#think space is dominated by a machine.#

[.s69]#*4) Death*:#[.s6]#The personas inflict mental attacks #[.s7]#on each other.
A successful attack will result in a #[.s4]#combination^&#8211;^ mind blank-death attack.
If the #[.s3]#persona is killed, and then resuscitated, she must #[.s4]#start life with a blanked mind.
Note that the #[.s3]#mental attack effects are simultaneous, and rare.#

*5) Mental Mutation*: Some how the receiver think space has combined with the donor think space to create a new and wonder mental mutation.
This should be permanent, but the referee may limit it as she sees fit.
The new mutation is new to the think space of the persona so she must figure it out on her own.
Lots of fun.
The mutation is rolled in Chapter 58: Mental Mutations and cannot be a defect.

[.s4]#*Less Failure Through Science*: The higher the tech level of the cerebro #[.s7]#converter, the more effective the device is.
Higher tech level converters can carry out more complex #[.s18]#conversions requiring less personnel.
#[.s8]#Consult Table 47.5: Converter Tech Level__ __to #[.s7]#determine the impact of tech level on the device.
The tech level of the cerebro converter is represented by it&#8217;s wate.
The less the converter&#8217;s wate the higher it&#8217;s tech level.
#[.s8]#If the DD is very high then several veterinarians #[.s4]#are required to work as a research team.
The #[.s6]#research team need not be composed solely of #[.s7]#veterinarians as biologists may prove helpful also.
See research teams in#[.s6]# http://expgame.com/?page_id=269#research-teams[Performance Tables], for more #[.s3]#information about how to achieve massive DD rolls.
Failure of this PT roll will result in failure of the procedure, and #[.s7]#rolls must be made onTable 47.4: Cerebro Side Effect#[.s3]#.#

[.s3]#The Cerebro Converter Tech table also lists #[.s6]#the maximum complexity of the maneuver that #can be attempted by the research team.
A low tech [.s7]#cerebro converter can only transpose the think space #[.s8]#of a patient into the body structure of a similar #patient.
As the tech level increases the PT roll will [.s5]#suffice for transfers from conscious to unconscious #[.s4]#patients, and then from oxygenated brains to #[.s3]#mechanical storage devices.
The type of subjects #[.s6]#that can be converted are listed in the Subject #limitations column of the +++<i>+++Cerebro Converter Tech +++</i>+++[.s7]#table.
The veterinarian in charge may attempt any #[.s6]#maneuver she delights in, but the referee must #[.s3]#increase the DD of the maneuver accordingly.#

[table id=606 /]

== [.s70]#17) Cloning Equipment# {.p4}

[table id=607 /]

Cloning Equipment can rapidly reproduce any life form if it is given a fraction of the original life form [.s10]#to work from.
The clone will be a verbatim cellular #[.s19]#construct, but it will lack the personality, #intelligence and knowledge of the body that it has [.s8]#been formed from.
The clone will have all the #[.s5]#cellular maturity, but it will lack the life experience #[.s8]#that the original organic creature had gathered #[.s3]#over the years.
The clone will, however, have all the physiological attributes of its sample.#

[.s6]#The clone is nothing more than a mobile #[.s8]#statue made from the same meats and ligaments #as the sample.
The clone cannot speak a language, and must be run as a referee persona.
The sample [.s16]#donor has no control over the clone.
If the #[.s8]#veterinarians creating the clone wish to impart knowledge onto their creation they must use a #[.s3]#cerebro converter.#

[.s7]#The more advanced the cloning equipment is #[.s5]#the less of a sample that is needed to synthesize the clone.
A low tech cloning machine needs to have a #[.s3]#whole body present for the entire process, which #[.s6]#can be many hours.
A very high tech level cloning #machine needs only to have a small sample of the [.s7]#organism present to create the clone.
The sample #[.s8]#must be present for the entire cloning process.
#[.s7]#There is some damage done to the sample as little #bits of it are snipped off and homogenized to have [.s3]#their genetic components analyzed.
The type of #[.s4]#sample needed and the damage done to it is #[.s3]#determined on Table 47.6: Cloning Machine Tech Level#[.s71]#_._#

[.s16]#The DD of using a cloning machine is #[.s7]#exceptionally high in an effort to assure that more #[.s8]#than one veterinarian is operating the device at once#[.s7]#.
Cloning requires a http://expgame.com/?page_id=269#research-teams[research team] must usually be formed #[.s3]#to successfully clone an organism.
The cloning #[.s7]#machine requires at least one veterinarian present, #[.s5]#but a research team operating this device could be #[.s7]#composed of vets and biologists.
If the PT roll is #[.s8]#unsuccessful, the cloning attempt automatically #fails.

[.s7]#Even a successful PT roll still has a #[.s4]#chance of failure.
The chance of a successful #[.s3]#cloning depends on how long the research team #[.s4]#waits for the brew to be finished.
The initial #conception and gestation takes one hour.
The clone [.s7]#ages one year for every following hour.
If the clone is removed before the sample&#8217;s age is reached, the #[.s8]#ratio (hours/years of sample) is the percentage #[.s18]#chance for success.
If the research team were #[.s3]#cloning an organism that is 40 years of age, and #[.s8]#they left the clone in the brewing tank for a total #[.s5]#of 30 hours there would be a 75% chance of success.#

[.s7]#If the cloning process fails the either because #[.s3]#of an unsuccessful PT roll, or because the clone #didn&#8217;t brew long enough the consequences are up to [.s19]#the referee.
Most often the clone will fail #[.s7]#catastrophically, resembling nothing more than a #jumbling blob of bones, tubes, organs and rumpled skin.
Occasionally clones will also flop around and bellow.
Failed rapid cloning is not for the faint of cardiac pump.

If the process fails there is a 25% chance (less [.s7]#1% per tech level), that the machine will suffer a #[.s4]#breakdown.
The severity of the breakdown is #[.s7]#rolled on the http://expgame.com/?page_id=286[Extent of Damage] table in chapter 21 #[.s4]#of the rule book (ed note.
hahaha book).
Regardless of maintenance #[.s3]#problems, the cloning equipment must cool down #for 2 hours per hour of use before being used again.

== 18) Coma Control Box {.p100}

[table id=608 /]

[.s5]#A Coma Control Box will regulate an unconscious #[.s8]#persona&#8217;s healing processes.
A comatose persona #[.s7]#is one whose hit point total is less than zero.
This #[.s3]#device ensures that the persona will not lose hit #[.s7]#points.
The persona cannot be moved once attached #[.s3]#to this device.
The coma control unit cannot halt #the effects of poisons or pharmaceuticals.
Damage [.s7]#inflicted while the box is attached is still inflicted, and the coma control unit can do nothing to prevent #[.s3]#it.
The coma control unit can only regulate, and #[.s7]#cannot intervene or heal.
A battery set will last 25 days.
This device must be attached by a biologist, #[.s3]#mechanic, or veterinarian.
This unit offers a +20 #[.s7]#bonus on a vet&#8217;s PT roll when she is working with #[.s3]#comatose patients.#

== 19) Comfy Couch {.p6}

[table id=610 /]

[.s10]#A comfy couch is a stretcher that keeps the patient(s) #[.s6]#hovering above its surface:^,^ by anti-gray.
The #[.s8]#stretcher itself hovers above the ground, and can #be pulled around without any effect on the carrier&#8217;s [.s8]#wate allowance.
It can support up to 250kg (less the wate of extra devices).
Unless diverted, the #[.s10]#stretcher will continue to hover along at 1 h/u in the #[.s3]#direction it was originally started in.
One set of #[.s8]#batteries will run the stretcher for 15 days.#

[.s10]#Every couch gets 0-3 (d4-1) additional medical #[.s4]#devices built in.
These operate on their own #battery sets and increase the statistics of the couch [.s6]#accordingly.
See the Comfy Couch Equipment #[.s7]#Table for a list of additional built-in goodies.
The comfy couch&#8217;s extra items will automatically jump #[.s5]#into action when an injured persona is placed in the #couch.
The couch will offer an award of +10 for the [.s8]#vet when she is making PT rolls for maneuvers which require a stabilized patient.#

== 20) Consciousness Headband {.p7}

[.s78]#[table id=612 /]#

[.s78]#When wrapped around the head of a #[.s3]#anthropomorph, this device can instantly restore consciousness.
It is integrated with the wearer&#8217;s nervous system, and will jump start the limbic system if it appears #[.s7]#to be failing.
The headband can be worn constantly #[.s10]#to prevent loss of consciousness from poisons, shock, #[.s77]#physical damage, or mental attacks.
If #[.s7]#consciousness is to be maintained the player must #[.s3]#make a successful recovery roll for her persona.
#[.s7]#Regardless of the persona&#8217;s physical state she will #[.s6]#have no less than a 10% chance of making her #[.s3]#recovery roll.
The consciousness head band will #[.s8]#require one use per extra recovery roll that the #[.s7]#persona needs to remain conscious.
Each use will #[.s3]#inflict 0-3 hit points of electrical damage to the #[.s9]#persona#.

== 21) Cauterizing Ray {.p120}

[.s5]#[table id=613 /]#

[.s5]#This device is normally used to heal the stumps of #[.s7]#amputated digits or limbs.
The ray sterilizes and arrests blood loss in one unit.
The ray can be used #[.s6]#by a veterinarian in cases of severe trauma to #[.s3]#increase her PT roll by +20.#

[.s3]#When wielded as a weapon, the cauterizing #[.s10]#ray attacks as a type C weapon.
The ray has a #[.s80]#+++<b>+++1 +++</b>+++#[.s10]#hex #[.s3]#range and inflicts 4 to 24 hit points of damage.
#Each attack uses 8 units of battery drain.
The [.s3]#damage inflicted only effects organic creatures, #[.s8]#and cannot be regenerated.
#[.s7]#For instance a hit with this weapon inflicting 16 hit points would reduce the target&#8217;s hit points #[.s3]#maximum by 16.
The referee should only use this as a weapon against player personas in extreme #[.s7]#situations.
Only a Rejuv Chamber can return #[.s3]#the persona to her original hit points maximum.
No pharmaceuticals, mutations, or other gadgets will restore the damaged #[.s81]#HPS #[.s3]#max.
A battery set will last for 20 units.#

== [.s22]#23) Drug Box# {.p129}

[table id=615 /]

[.s4]#There are two versions of the drug box.
The #[.s7]#smaller (10 kg) of the two is a drug analyzer.
The #larger version (35 kg) is a drug analyzer and synthesizer.
A drug [.s7]#box will be the smaller analyzer 75% of the time.
The #[.s3]#referee may let the player roll this, or she could choose whichever device is more appropriate for #[.s8]#her campaign.
#[.s3]#Both boxes have 1000 turns of energy in a #[.s8]#battery set.
An analysis takes 6-60 turns, and a #[.s18]#synthesis takes 60-480 turns (1-8 hours).
The #[.s7]#check for success is rolled at the end of this period.
#[.s6]#So the persona must wait until the machine is #[.s3]#finished before knowing what has happened.#

[.s18]#*Drug Analyzer* (EXPS 250;
Value 50000): The drug analyzer is the #[.s5]#smaller portable version (10kg) of the Drug Box.
#[.s3]# The analyzer will analyze a compound, determine if it is a pharmaceutical and identify it#[.s7]#.
A veterinarian using a drug analyzer will earn a bonus of +50 when making pharmaceutical #[.s5]#related PT rolls.
The following information may be #[.s3]#obtained by the machine: pharmaceutical type, effects, duration, side effects, and value.#

[.s19]#The analyzer prefers a full dose of the #[.s5]#pharmaceutical to use for study;
this will double its chances for successful analysis.
The normal process #[.s7]#may consume a small portion of the dose, however #this should not affect the performance of the [.s7]#pharmaceutical.
The percentage chance for success #is equal to the tech level of the drug box, divided by [.s3]#the tech level of the pharmaceutical plus a random value of 1 #[.s8]#to 6.
This value can never be higher than 80%.#

*[.s7]#Chance for Analysis Success#*

*[.s10]#Tech Level Box  plus Vet Level / (Tech Level + d6)  Maximum#[.s3]# 80%#*

[.s3]#The chance for successful analysis must be rolled for each of the five separate categories of pharmaceutical information that can be acquired.
#[.s7]#For example the analyzer may determine possible #side effects for a pharmaceutical, but not determine [.s3]#its value or type.#

[.s28]#+++<strong>+++Drug Synthesizer +++</strong>+++(EXPS 900 Value 900 000):#[.s7]#In addition to determining #[.s3]#all of the above information, the drug synthesizer #[.s5]#is capable of recreating any pharmaceutical that it has analyzed.
#[.s3]#The larger version of the Drug Box has a wate of 35kg.#[.s3]# A veterinarian will receive a bonus of +75 on any #[.s8]#pharmaceutical related PT rolls with this machine.#

[.s5]#To synthesize an analyzed pharmaceutical , a #[.s8]#whole dose must be destroyed.
The chance for #[.s3]#success depends on analysis and on the ability of the drug box to synthesize the raw components.
#[.s7]#The device must first correctly analyze each of the #[.s9]#5 components listed in the drug analyzer #[.s8]#paragraphs.
The veterinarian, or biologist can #[.s3]#adjust the chance of success, or earn additional rolls by making PT rolls &#8221;#

*[.s7]#Chance for Synthesis Success#*

*[.s10]#Tech Level Box plus Vet Level / (Tech Level + 2d8) Maximum#[.s3]# 80%#*

[.s3]#If the synthesis is successful, the new drug will be identical to the original sample, although the newly synthesized pharmaceutical will have #[.s7]#double the chance of side effects.
If the synthesis #[.s8]#failed the drug box should have fail safes that #[.s5]#prevent the production of random pharmaceuticals, or poisons.
#[.s7]#The drug box can keep producing a single dose of #[.s12]#the pharmaceutical as often as a successful #[.s3]#synthesis roll is made.#

[table id=616 /]

[.s3]#The eye cleansers look like opaque swimming #[.s10]#goggles.
When strapped over the eyes they foam up and bathe the eyes in healing chemicals.
They will negate, and heal, all forms of chemical damage to anthropomorph eyes.
If hit point damage has been #[.s7]#caused by the chemical attack to the eyes, all of #those hit points in damage will be restored.
Eye [.s10]#cleansers can only be used once and will act in one #[.s5]#unit.
The eye cleansers will offer a bonus of +8 for #any eye related PT rolls that the veterinarian has to make.

It can restore and #[.s3]#maintain the proper body temperature of any #[.s10]#organic creature.
Any internal conditions (poison, #[.s8]#sickness, mental attack) causing fever can be #[.s10]#countered by the blanket.
It can maintain normal body temperatures against external environments #within the range of -10C and +50C.
[.s10]#A veterinarian or biologist can use the blanket #to determine a patient&#8217;s body temperature.
They [.s8]#will also receive a +10 bonus when using the #[.s4]#blanket for any PT rolls that involve body #temperature.
[.s10]#The blanket will function until it is damaged.
#[.s5]#The blanket can take 3 hit points of damage before #[.s4]#it is destroyed.
An fever control blanket is #[.s7]#disposable, and cannot be mended.

== 27) Injury Detector {.p134}

[table id=619 /]

[.s8]#This handy little red box will analyze the body #[.s7]#structure of any organic creature for injury.
When #attached to the body, it will detect almost anything [.s3]#from ligament strains to rigor mortis.
The Injury #[.s5]#Detector will aid vets by adding 50 to their PT rolls #[.s8]#when dealing with any maneuver that involves #[.s6]#physical lesions.
A battery set is good for one #[.s3]#hundred applications to the body.#+++<figure id="attachment_10194" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10194" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i1.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/danger_in_deep_3-300x249.png?resize=300%2C249[Tom Corbett Space Cadet Adventure: Danger In Deep Space By Carey Rockwell, Tech adviser Willy Ley.

== 28) Internal Viewer {.p6}

[table id=621 /]

[.s5]#This device gives a three dimensional, technicolor, #[.s7]#moving picture of the innards of organic creatures.
#[.s6]#The paddles of the internal viewer must make #contact with the patient.
The internal views can be [.s5]#taped, and subjected to a host of special effects.
An #[.s3]#Internal Viewer will aid vet diagnostics with +30 #[.s7]#on her PT roll.
This unit is generally not portable (unless its tech level produces a wate is less than 6 #kg).
If the internal viewer is part of a comfy couch then it will assist 10 diagnoses per battery set.

== 29) Life Ray {.p6}

[table id=622 /]

[.s7]#A life ray will resurrect dead organic tissue almost #[.s3]#to its original form.
Enormous energy surges (like lightning) are #[.s5]#used to rehydrate desiccated cells, restore chemical #[.s3]#equilibriums, and rebalance biological polarities.
#[.s5]#The Life Ray must be employed within 50 hours of #[.s7]#death.
The Life Ray is a machine, and the subject #[.s8]#must be placed within it.#

[.s7]#The life ray will faithfully restore the body to #[.s8]#the from that is presented to it.
The ray will not #[.s3]#heal or repair anything.
Any corrective surgery #[.s7]#must be completed before the life ray is activated.
For instance a limb would only be reconnected to #[.s4]#the regenerated patient only if her arm were #[.s3]#properly reconnected before the restoration procedure.#

[.s9]#To properly activate the life ray is a #[.s8]#veterinarian maneuver that increases by 1DD #[.s3]#per hour since death.
For example, a patient that #[.s10]#has been dead for 6 hours would be a DD6 maneuver.
#If a body has been placed in a stasis bag, the time [.s6]#within the bag does not count.
For instance a #patient that had been dead for three days, but was [.s7]#placed in a stasis bag 4 hours after dying would be #[.s3]#a 4DD maneuver to resuscitate.#

[.s3]#To be restored, the persona has two chances #to make a normal (d20) CON http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#attribute-rolls[attribute roll].
If the [.s7]#player is successful with either of these rolls then #[.s5]#the persona will have been successfully restored.
If the #[.s8]#player fails both of the attribute rolls then the #[.s6]#persona is permanently dead.
The veterinarian #[.s7]#can carry out maneuvers that will allow the player #[.s8]#to make additional attribute rolls.#

[.s7]#If the player fails the attribute rolls then the persona remains dead, since her system is too far #[.s3]#along the entropy road to be restored.
If the vet, #or the research team, fails the PT roll involved then [.s5]#the patient can be placed in suspension and an attempt can be #[.s18]#made at a later date: Any patient with a zero #[.s3]#attribute will die immediately unless the problem #[.s8]#is corrected preceding, or during the life ray #[.s18]#treatment.
#

[.s5]#The life ray does not return the persona to her #[.s3]#exact state of health.
Since the device does not #[.s6]#repair damage that was incurred the persona&#8217;s #[.s7]#attributes will suffer penalties once life is restored.
#[.s8]#All attributes are reduced by at least one point #[.s3]#during the process.#

[.s7]#It is assumed that all attributes except MSTR #[.s22]#will have suffered when the persona died.
AWE, CHA, #[.s10]#CON, DEX, INT, PSTR and #[.s68]#HPS #[.s10]#maximum will lose 0 #[.s16]#to 3 points (d4-1).
However, the persona&#8217;s #[.s7]#think space may be enlightened by the potentially #[.s3]#spiritual experience and a bonus of 0 to 3 points MSTR#[.s5]# is added to her present MSTR.
If any of the #[.s19]#persona&#8217;s attributes fall below one, she is #[.s8]#permanently dead.#

[.s7]#Once the body is technically restored by the machine, the persona must be brought back to life.
#[.s3]#Her hit point total will be at negative 1/4 of the maximum hit points.
For example, a persona with 20 HPS MAX would restart life at -5 HPS total.
Now a veterinarian must successfully resuscitate #[.s7]#the patient, or she will die again.
Often the referee will allow the vet to automatically succeed at this point#.

[.s7]#Unless this machine is employed absolutely #[.s6]#ruthlessly (under the premise that all personas #will eventually die), it can seriously imbalance the [.s7]#game.
If a referee has any reason not to allow a life #[.s3]#ray to part of her campaign then she simply can #[.s10]#replace this device with some other piece of medical #equipment.

== [.s7]#30) Limb Capper# {.p143}

[table id=623 /]

[.s3]#A limb capper is a flexible bowl-shaped super-#[.s5]#bandage that is used to preserve the nerve endings, #[.s3]#tendons, and muscles of amputated limbs while at #[.s6]#the same time preventing further damage, and #[.s18]#reducing pain.
This artifact&#8217;s prompt use will #[.s6]#facilitate automatic biorganic attachment.
The #[.s3]#Limb Capper can only be used once, and will aid #[.s8]#the vet with a bonus of +5 for any PT rolls that #[.s3]#involve preserving tissue.#

== 31) Medi Kit {.p6}

[table id=624 /]

The medi kit is a disposable one user personal medical aid for veterinarians.
The kit contains bio electric painkillers, tissue and bone adhesives, organic tissue cutting acids, spray on bandages, and benign fur removers.
Everything melts into uselessness after the seal has been broken in an [.s3]#effort to prevent unsanitary re-use.
Medi-kits are #[.s7]#also called vedi-kits, med-paks, and first aid kits.
#[.s3]#The Medi-kit awards +20 to pretty much any PT roll.#

== [.s22]#32) Medi Wraps# {.p140}

[table id=625 /]

[.s17]#A medi wrap is patch of synthetic skin that melts #[.s3]#onto the wounded skin of the patient.
The wrap #[.s10]#will heal up to 30 hit points of specific skin damage.
#[.s3]#Once applied to the injured skin, its effects are #[.s10]#immediate and any further damage will be impeded.
#[.s7]#Medi wraps can be used only once.
If an injury is #[.s3]#to a smaller surface area than the medi wrap, a #[.s5]#veterinarian can cut the wrap if a 3DD performance #[.s7]#table roll is made.
This procedure will extend the #[.s3]#the medi wrap by one use.#

[.s8]#A burn medi wrap is only good for heat, #[.s3]#friction and flame damage.
Veterinarians are the #only personas capable of criss-crossing medi wrap [.s3]#uses.
To do this a 1DD maneuver must be made.
For instance a burn medi-wrap could be used to heal the burn from an acid.
When cross wrapping is done the wrap will only heal 10 hit points of damage.
Referees must remember that most of #[.s8]#laser and projectile weapon damage is internal, #[.s3]#and a medi-wrap will only be able to assist for a small portion of that type of damage.#

[table id=626 /]

== 33) Medical Kit {.p149}

[table id=627 /]

[.s3]#A Medical Kit is equivalent to the bulk storage of #[.s7]#fifty medi kits.
The medi #[.s6]#kits are dispensed by a small diagnostic #[.s7]#computer.
The small diagnostic computer that can #[.s3]#aid any persona, whether medically trained or not, in the proper steps to first aid.
The computer will #[.s8]#give vets a +42 bonus on the performance table rolls for any maneuvers that involve acute care (quick fixes, poison cures).
The computer aids #[.s4]#personas who are not vets, but meet the #[.s42]#+++<b>+++INT +++</b>+++#[.s5]#requirements of a vet (INT 12)in the area of first aid.
#[.s7]#Any such persona can apply quick fixes (and only #[.s10]#quick fixes) when using a medical kit.
The diagnostic #[.s7]#computer runs out of power, and the stores run out #[.s3]#of materials, after 50 uses.
Recharging a medical #[.s6]#kit is left to the improvisational talents of the #referee.

== 34) Metab Counter {.p6}

[table id=628 /]

[.s19]#A Metab Counter will graphically monitor #[.s7]#respiration, blood flow, brain wave activity, and a #few other useless metabolic indicators.
The metab [.s16]#counter is the classic futuristic physician&#8217;s #[.s7]#stethoscope.
This device has a 10 hex directional #range.
Vets, and biologists, can use the metab counter [.s7]#to locate life forms, and to determine their health.
#[.s10]#Veterinarians get a bonus of +15 on any vet PT rolls #[.s3]#when employing a Metab Counter.
Biologists get #[.s7]#+10 on their PT rolls when using a metab counter.
#[.s3]#One battery set will operate for 10000 units.#

== 35) Mood Ball {.p14}

[table id=629 /]

[.s19]#The mood ball will alter and maintain the #[.s3]#disposition of the holder.
If they are depressed it #[.s5]#will make them happy, if they get angry it will calm #[.s3]#them down.
These moods can also be adjusted by a skilled individual to manipulate the emotions of #[.s8]#a single target within 1 hex range.
There is no #[.s3]#saving throw granted since the mood alterations are quite subtle.
The mood ball is a psychiatric #[.s10]#device that employs electrical signals and inaudible sounds to maintain socially acceptable personalities #[.s3]#from the user.
#[.s3]#The mood ball is not a mind control device.
#The user is aware that she is employing the ball for [.s10]#her own benefit, since they will be genuinely happier #[.s7]#when the ball is activated.
A veterinarian can use #[.s3]#the mood ball to assist her in any psychological #[.s5]#performance table rolls.
These would include calm #[.s4]#persona, remove suicidal thoughts, entice a #purchase, subliminal suggestion, or pain reduction.
[.s3]#The veterinarian will earn a bonus of +15 when #[.s7]#dealing with emotion, ovitiood related maneuvers.#

[.s7]#Other personas can use the mood ball to assist #[.s8]#in salesmanship or coercion.
The mood ball is #[.s7]#reflected by a negotiation roll, or PT roll bonus of #+10.
A persona that is frequently subjected to the [.s10]#emotional adjustments of the mood ball may become #[.s3]#dependant on the device.#

== 36) Mutation Detector {.p4}

[table id=1059 /]

[.s5]#The mutation detector provides a binary answer #to the question whether mutations are present and whether the mutations physical or mental.
Beyond [.s5]#this, the device cannot give any hints what-so-ever #[.s3]#regarding the nature of the mutation.
If a mutant #[.s7]#were tested, and she had both physical and mental #[.s3]#mutations, the mutation detector would light up #brightly.
[.s7]#A biologist can employ the detector to gain a #[.s6]#PT bonus of +20 when attempting to identify #[.s3]#mutations#[.s7]#.
The #[.s3]#gadget must have an unobstructed line-of-sight, #[.s6]#and can be no further than 10 hexes from the #[.s8]#specimen.
One battery set will last 5000 units.#

== 37) Neuro Cap {.p4}

[table id=630 /]

[.s3]#This medical device appears to be an oversized #[.s10]#beanie with a yellow blinking light on top.
The cap #[.s8]#constantly generates a think space interference #[.s3]#waveform that makes it virtually impossible for #[.s5]#any form of psionic intrusion to succeed.
The neuro #[.s3]#cap will not defend against those mental attacks #[.s8]#which manipulate the environment around the #target.
It will, however, work very well against the [.s3]#likes of ESP, pyrokinesis, and mental control.#

[.s5]#Mental attacks must first make a save against #[.s3]#twice the persona&#8217;s #[.s96]#MSTR #[.s3]#before they can attack.
#[.s7]#This value (2 times MSTR) cannot be less than 20.
#[.s18]#Thus a persona with a 15 #[.s97]#MSTR #[.s18]#would have a #[.s4]#barrier of mental strength equal to 30.
If the #[.s3]#persona&#8217;s #[.s96]#MSTR #[.s3]#were 6, her mental barrier would #[.s10]#be 20.
The Neuro Cap is just a machine;
it will also obstruct beneficial psionic activity, and any mental #mutation used by the persona must save vs 2 times [.s3]#her #[.s96]#MSTR #[.s3]#before it can be employed.#

== 38) Poison Detector {.p4}

[table id=631 /]

[.s10]#The poison detector can forewarn the expedition of #[.s3]#unconfined toxic materials, and give diagnostic #[.s7]#information about poisoned patients.
The detector #[.s5]#has a 10 hex directional range, and will give an idea #of the poison&#8217;s toxicity (poison intensity).
[.s5]#Contacting the detector to a poisoned patient&#8217;s body will give vets essential information about the #[.s3]#patient.
The poison detector gives vets +25 their #[.s7]#PT roll when treating poisoned personas.
A bonus #of +10 on PT rolls is granted to nomads, biologists, [.s5]#and vets doing research with the aid of the poison #[.s3]#detector.
The detector will indicate whether the #[.s7]#poisonous materials are of a radioactive, corrosive, or biochemically toxic nature.#

== 39) Poison Box {.p14}

[table id=1060 /]

[.s3]#A Poison Box will detect, locate and identify any #[.s7]#amount of toxic substances within a 20 hex radius.
#[.s6]#If a Poison Box can obtain one gram of a particular #[.s8]#poison, it can synthesize 10 doses of antidote.
#[.s6]#Synthesis of antidote requires 1 to 8 hours of #[.s3]#battery use.
If the antidote is taken immediately #[.s8]#after the poison attack, the persona will get an #[.s3]#additional saving throw where the persona&#8217;s #[.s96]#CON #[.s7]#will be doubled against that specific poison attack.
#[.s7]#If the antidote is not present, and no medical #[.s5]#aid is available the persona can be attached to the #poison box, and the continued effects of the poison [.s3]#will be stopped.
The persona cannot act, but will #[.s5]#not take damage from the poison until the machine #[.s7]#runs out of power.#

[.s8]#If medical attention is present, a vet using this device will get +115 on her PT rolls when #[.s3]#working against poison.
Biologists and nomads #[.s7]#will get +40 on poison related PT rolls when using #[.s3]#the poison box.
This device has no effect if the #[.s6]#persona is already dead.
Only under the most #[.s5]#extreme circumstances can the poison box be altered #[.s4]#to generate poisons.
This goes against every #[.s5]#nanocircuit in the device&#8217;s programming, to attempt #this should be at least a 25DD mechanic maneuver.

== 40) Psionic Box {.p154}

[table id=632 /]

[.s3]#The psionic box is like a psionic stethoscope.
#[.s7]#.
The device contains materials that #absorb psionic energy wavelengths, and frequency [.s5]#generators that can constructively, or destructively #[.s3]#interfere with think space wave forms.
The veterinarian can #[.s7]#use the psionic box to probe the local area (15 hex) for psionic anomaly.
#[.s6]#The box is an elaborate detector that will #[.s3]#betray the presence of any mental mutations (but #[.s6]#not physical mutations), or manipulations of a #[.s3]#psionic nature.
For instance the psionic box could be used to eavesdrop on telepathic conversations, #or send out simplistic psionic signals.
Any psionic [.s7]#related PT rolls attempted by the device&#8217;s user will gain a bonus of +102.#

[.s7]#If the hair net like extension of the device is #[.s3]#attached to the scalp of a suspected mutant, there is a chance of determining what mental mutations the persona has.
Not which mental mutation it is, #[.s7]#but what it does.
Time stop mutation would reveal the ability to manipulate time, and not something #[.s4]#called time stop.
If the persona saves versus #[.s3]#mental attack of intensity 4 to 24, the psionic box #[.s19]#will yield no information.
The level of the #[.s3]#veterinarian making the assessment can be added #[.s7]#to the intensity, increasing her chances of success.
#[.s10]#Such a probe will take 1 to 100 units of melodramatic #agony.
[.s3]# This requires a successful maneuver of DD12 for a veterinarian (DD16 for #biologists).
[.s7]#If this device happens to be combined with a #[.s5]#cerebro converter, the victim&#8217;s mind can be searched #[.s3]#like a roll-a-dex for vital information.#

== 41) Race Determiner {.p38}

[table id=633 /]

[.s3]#This unit analyzes skin, bone, blood and tissue composition to determine the racial stock of the subject.
The subject can be either dead, or alive.
#[.s4]#The data is yielded after 1 to 20 units of the determiner&#8217;s analyzing the subject.
Vets and #[.s5]#biologists can enter information on new races, and #[.s3]#program the device to identify them.
A Biologist will receive a bonus of +30 on her PT roll when #[.s18]#making identification maneuvers with a race #determiner.
Vets can earn a +10 bonus on their PT [.s7]#rolls when making identification type maneuvers #[.s3]#with this device.
One battery set will last 5000 #units.

== 42) Rejuv Chamber {.p6}

[table id=634 /]

[.s3]#The rejuv chamber is a tank like device that is #[.s7]#capable of healing virtually any damage provided #[.s4]#that the patient is still alive.
It will remove #[.s3]#bullets, replace burned skin;
set and pin bones, #[.s6]#excise tumours, drain swellings, trephinate, #[.s5]#realign blood chemistry, filter out toxins, and groom #[.s8]#the patient&#8217;s hair, nails and skin.
After a stint in #[.s3]#a rejuv chamber the patient will feel refreshed, clean, and alive.#

[.s3]#The rejuv chamber can only work with the #[.s7]#material that is presented to it.
The chamber will #[.s3]#repair nerves with bits of nerve it excises from other parts of the patient.
It will culture muscle #[.s10]#from one leg to replace it in the other.
Through this #[.s5]#shifting of bodily materials the rejuv chamber can #[.s8]#restore lost hit points and decreased attributes.
#[.s7]#The rejuv chamber has some limits as to what #[.s5]#it can accomplish when healing.
The rejuv chamber #[.s3]#will restore a persona to a full hit points total.
It will also restore to full any one attribute that has #[.s10]#been reduced for any reason (aging, disease, poison).
#[.s3]#If the persona has more than one attribute below #[.s8]#normal, the restored attribute will be randomly #[.s4]#determined.
A Rejuv Chamber cannot restore #[.s63]#MSTR or cure insanity.#

[.s8]#Since the rejuv chamber uses the patient&#8217;s #[.s3]#own body tissue to repair damage, there is some #[.s8]#risk when the machine is used.
A patient should #[.s7]#not use the rejuv chamber to repair herself if she is #[.s8]#at a positive HPS total.
The rejuv chamber will scavenge bits of tissue that are essential to the #[.s7]#persona&#8217;s attributes to repair the #[.s67]#HPS #[.s7]#damage.
The #[.s3]#rejuv chamber will return the hit points to full, but #[.s8]#at the expense of a randomly selected attribute.
#[.s3]#The persona will get all her hit points back, but a fifth of the healed hit points will be subtracted from #[.s7]#a randomly selected attribute, this can quite easily #[.s4]#kill the persona.
If the persona has a reduced #[.s19]#attribute the rejuv chamber will repair the #[.s3]#decreased attribute.#

If a persona with a HPS max of 35 were to hop into a rejuv chamber with a 15 HPS total and no damaged [.s7]#attributes she would be healed to full.
The 20 HPS#[.s67]#* *#[.s7]#that she was healed would result in 4 points being #[.s3]#subtracted from a random attribute.
If the persona #[.s18]#only had a 4 PSTR#[.s62]#+++<b>+++, +++</b>+++#[.s18]#and #[.s62]#PSTR #[.s18]#was the selected #[.s3]#attribute the rejuv chamber would have accidentally killed her.#

[.s6]#If a persona enters the rejuv chamber at a #[.s7]#negative hit points total she will be repaired to her HPS#[.s42]#* *#[.s7]#maximum without any attribute penalties.
A #[.s19]#Rejuv Chamber will also remove parasitic #[.s6]#infestations, diseases, poison effects, and non #[.s8]#permanent pharmaceuticals without affecting a #[.s6]#persona&#8217;s attributes.
If the patient is at full hit #[.s7]#points, and full attributes, the rejuv chamber will #[.s3]#remove tumours, and give wonderful manicures without deleterious effects.#

[.s6]#One treatment requires an uninterrupted 1#[.s5]#6 hours in the coffin like tank of the rejuv chamber.
#[.s7]#Interrupting a rejuv chamber treatment will usually #[.s3]#kill a patient instantly, and messily.
The chamber #[.s7]#is largely self directed and will automatically begin #[.s3]#to operate when a patient is closed under the lid.
#[.s6]#Veterinarians can manipulate the rejuv chamber #[.s3]#to assist them is surgical operations and medical #[.s8]#maneuvers involving extreme trauma.
A veteri#[.s6]#narian enjoys a bonus of +50 on virtually any #[.s3]#medical procedure when using a rejuv chamber.#

[table id=635 /]

[.s8]#A Respirator will monitor, regulate and restore respiration in oxygen users.
Worn over the nose #[.s99]#and mouth, this unit will monitor an #[.s3]#anthropomorph&#8217;s respiration without any battery drain.
If it notices any respiratory irregularities, it #will start to breath for the persona.
The device will [.s3]#filter out toxic substances in the air, but does not have its own air supply.
The Respirator will warn #[.s6]#of heart stoppage, but will continue operating #[.s12]#regardless for 5 hours (9000 units), or until #[.s8]#disconnected.
This artifact can be combined with a cardio vest to maintain life.

== 44) Scalpel {.p159}

[table id=636 /]

[.s4]#This lazer Scalpel is very exacting, and makes #[.s7]#adjustable shallow incisions.
A scalpel will easily #cut through any organic covering.
As a weapon, it [.s5]#does little damage, a d6 hit points if a hit is scored, #[.s3]#with no PSTR#[.s96]#* *#[.s3]#bonus.
When attacking, the scalpel #[.s7]#gets +200 to hit against organics, and attacks as a type C weapon.
A lazer scalpel offers a +15 bonus for PT roll to vets, or biologists, engaging in any #cutting procedure.
The portable unit will run for 5 [.s3]#hours (9000 units).#

== 45) Stasis Bag {.p165}

[table id=637 /]

[.s3]#The stasis bag is the body bag of the future.
All #[.s6]#organic processes are arrested within the bag.
#This means that there is no decomposition, no need [.s5]#for respiration, and no need for food.
The stasis bag #[.s6]#will suspend any organic material in a steady #state: lunches;
bodies, limbs, eyes for the eye bank, [.s5]#and even whole unconscious organisms.
The auto-embalmer cannot hold an unwilling occupant, and #[.s4]#anyone could thrash their way out of the thin #container.

[.s8]#A Stasis Bag will operate safely between &#8211;#[.s9]#80°C and +80°C.
Stasis Bags that are not #[.s3]#successfully opened by a vet or biologist (DD5) #[.s7]#have a 1% chance per year of storage of explosive spoiling.
#[.s6]#Spoiled contents will be asphyxiated, dead, or #[.s8]#under accelerated aromatic decomposition.
One bag can #[.s3]#hold 150 kg.
Larger bags increase in value (+1000 #[.s10]#) and wate (+200 gm) for every additional 150 kg of #capacity.

== 46) Touch Gloves {.p30}

[table id=638 /]

[.s5]#Touch gloves appear as thin surgical gloves.
When #pulled on they melt into the skin, locating the touch and pressure receptors in the persona&#8217;s digits.
The gloves amplify the receptor&#8217;s sensitivity, and spread [.s10]#out their area of effect.
This produces hypersensitive #[.s3]#touch of such clarity that the user can almost feel #[.s8]#air molecules careening off her fingertips.
The gloves cannot be removed, but will wear off in #[.s7]#about 1 to 4 days.
Industrious washing can remove the gloves sooner.#

[.s8]#Anyone wearing touch gloves will enjoy a #[.s5]#general bonus of +1 on her #[.s101]#AWE+++<b>+++, +++</b>+++#[.s5]#and a specific #[.s101]#AWE #[.s5]#bonus of +3 when touch is involved.
There are other #[.s19]#more specific benefits gathered in various #[.s7]#situations.
Any persona who has lost her sense of #[.s8]#touch will have it restored in the hands, and her AWE#[.s96]#* *#[.s3]#returned to normal.
Mechanics get +20 on PT rolls for delicate repairs.
Veterinarians get +15 on #all non-surgery PT rolls, and +30 on all surgery PT [.s7]#rolls.
Spies get a +30 PT roll bonus when picking pockets, and opening locks.
Pilots and drivers will #[.s3]#earn +30 on driving performance tables.#

== *47) Translinker* {.p22}

[.s10]#[table id=639 /]#

[.s10]#The translinker is a bidirectional neural to machine connector#[.s64]#.
The translinker will allow a #[.s3]#veterinarian to directly interface with a piece of #medical equipment controlling it as an extension of [.s3]#her own mind.
The translinker would allow a vet #[.s6]#to integrate herself with a rejuv chamber and #[.s4]#make medical decisions along the way.
The #[.s8]#translinker allows her to visualize the device&#8217;s #[.s7]#data as part of her own memory structure, and to #[.s3]#control the device&#8217;s controls as part of her own #[.s7]#motor system.
She becomes at one with whatever #[.s6]#she translinks with.#

[.s19]#A translinker could also be used by a #[.s10]#mercenary to fire a piece of artillery, or by a spie to #[.s5]#bypass a security lock, or by a mechanic to drive a #[.s3]#space vehicle.
A translinker would allow virtual #[.s6]#access to a computer&#8217;s memory system.
If the #[.s8]#persona starts to use the translinker for things other than simple machines (robots or AI computers) there is a very real #[.s3]#risk of the machine gathering some control over the persona, or the persona becoming addicted to #[.s6]#the sensations translinking.#

[.s10]#The bonus for employing a piece of equipment #[.s6]#with a translinker is +50 on any PT rolls that #[.s8]#involve the device.
For example a veterinarian #[.s3]#using rejuv chamber through a translinker would be a formidable physician to say the least.
If the translinker is used with a device that does not have data or computer no bonus can be given.
For example a gun would not have any bonuses but a scope attached to gun might.
The to hit bonus would be +250 for smart guns or scopes.

[.s3]#The translinker can take on any format that #the referee wishes.
One the persona&#8217;s end it could require a socket in the [.s3]#skull, or it may simply fold like tin foil over the persona&#8217;s #[.s8]#head.
The connector could be a #[.s7]#cord, radio link, or a keyboard deck.
The device could have a plug or a nail #[.s3]#that is driven into the side of the machine.
