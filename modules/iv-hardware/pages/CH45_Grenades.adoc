= Grenades and Aerosols


This is the chapter devoted to technological area of effect weapons.
The classic area of effect weapon is the grenade, and the area of effect weapon of the future (or distant past), is the aerosol.
Each weapon type is discussed in the following paragraphs.
When a player is generating toys for her persona she should use Table 45.1: Grenade or Aerosol Type.
For convenience there tables devoted to just grenade types and and another devoted to just  aerosol types+++<i>+++.
+++</i>+++These tables should only be used by the referee when she specifically needs either a grenade or and aerosol.
The aerosol or grenade table is balanced for the generation of initial TOYs, but the aerosol and grenade only tables are not.
#

Grenades, and aerosols, generally act the same instant that they are detonated.
Only under #certain circumstances may a grenade explode later than one unit after being thrown.
Understanding Grenade and Aerosol combat in http://expgame.com/?page_id=304[Chapter 30] will be very helpful if you are using artifacts from this chapter#

== Grenade or Aerosol 

This is where a persona will generate an area of effect artifact when generating something from the TOY system.

== Grenades# 

A grenade is any hand, claw, or paw thrown area of effect weapon.
Grenades are remarkable for their ease of use, and even more remarkable for their deadliness.
The grenade is particularly #unintelligent, and will damage expedition members as indiscriminately as opponents.
No normal armour type can stop the damage of a grenade, and anything caught within the area of effect will be damaged.
There is only slim chance that a target will be able to avoid damage, and that is when the grenade is a dud.
There is only a 1 in 1000 chance that a grenade will be a dud.
Once a grenade is discharged (exploded), it is irretrievably lost.
#

=== Range# 

Grenades consume the hex that they explode in, and must be thrown a safe distance to avoid damaging the user.
The range of a grenade depends entirely on the thrower, and is equal to her PSTR* *#in hexes.
For grenade misses the grenade will land in a random nearby hex as determined in Grenade and Aerosol combat in http://expgame.com/?page_id=304[Chapter 30].#

=== Area Of Effect 

For all grenades, the area of effect represents the radius of the sphere in which all occupants are affected.
E.g., a fragmentation grenade has an area of effect of 1 hex.
Anything in an adjacent hex to the one in which the grenade exploded will be damaged.
Also, anything less than two hexes above the grenade will also be damaged.
All of these area effect blasts can include expedition members.#

=== Damage# 

This is the hit point range that is inflicted upon any target caught within the area of effect of the grenade.
Wherever the damage has been omitted, the grenade has some other special effect.
Remember that damage is rolled once, and applied to all targets within the area of effect.
Unless specified there is no save versus area of effect attacks.#

=== Wate# 

This is the wate of an unspent grenade, or aerosol.
An empty aerosol canister has a wate 10% of its original wate.
E.g., 2 kg aerosol is reduced to an empty 200 gm canister.#

=== EXPS 

Experience points for identifying a grenade, or aerosol, are earned the same as for any other artifact.
An equivalent experience point value can be earned after either weapon has been discharged, but these EXPS* *can only be earned by the firer.
#

=== Value# 

The value of a grenade, or aerosol, is the value #of one charge.
In some cases aerosols can generate more than one charge, but even with these modifications such aerosols still have the same #value.

=== Amount 

The referee must roll a d6 to determine the number of grenades that are found #in a cache.
For powerful campaign altering grenades one will suffice.

=== Trigger# 

To make the subject of grenades a little more confusing there are several different types of fuses.
For the convenience of the ref 9 out of 10 grenades are detonated by contact with the target hex, or any substantially solid object along its path.
All other grenades will have timers, and will explode 0 to 3 units after being #thrown.
Before a grenade will detonate, it must be triggered, and thrown.
A list of several different trigger types are given on Table 45.2: Grenade Trigger+++<i>+++.
+++</i>+++The trigger types do not require explanation, and simply indicate what must be done to activate the grenade.
For example, an inertia trigger is activated when the grenade goes #through a throwing motion, and a twist trigger will active when some device is twisted on the grenade.#

=== Description 

Not all grenades are created equal, and even grenades of the same type may have different shapes and colours.
These variations have arisen from the fact that different companies build their grenades differently, and even the same company may have packaged the same grenade differently from one military order to the next.
Grenades have no identifying markings at all.
Identification must be made by feel, and other indicators.
Roll once on Table 44.1: Bomb Shape+++<i>+++, +++</i>+++and once on Table 44.3: Colour Bomb__.__#

// insert table 434

// insert table 435 /] + [table id=437

// insert table 436

== Grenade Type 

If a the referee or persona only requires a grenade artifact roll on the table below.
Otherwise consult Table 45.1: Grenade or Aerosol above

// insert table 474

== 1) Big Bertha Grenade# 

// insert table 477

The big bertha is a massive concussion grenade.
All targets within the area of effect are automatically knocked down.
Any persona, or target, caught within 12 hexes of the epicenter must make a #recovery roll (see http://expgame.com/?page_id=267#recovery-roll[recovery roll]), or be stunned for 1-10 units.
All medium, or smaller, sized creatures within a 15 hex blast #radius must win a normal (d20) DEX attribute #roll, or be knocked down.
The effects of the big bertha are cumulative, so a target 8 hexes from the target hex would take damage, be knocked down, and have to make a recovery roll or be stunned.#

== 2) Chemical Explosive Grenade# 

// insert table 478

A chemical explosive grenade is the more typical concussion, fragmentation device that is commonly chucked about during war pix, and punk rock concerts.
The chemical explosive is the bigger sister of the Fragmentation grenade.#

== 3) Corrosive Grenade 

// insert table 479

The corrosive grenade bathes the area of effect with acids, alkalies, or non-neutralizing combinations of both.
The corrosive grenade's contents are highly volatile, but neutralize themselves almost automatically on organic #surfaces.

The corrosive nature of this ejected concoction will continue to eat away at inorganic materials--#such as: metals, plastic, rubber, etc.--unless washed off.
If items such as armour, weapons, or robots are left to corrode they will take an additional 2-20 #hit points of damage for each of the continuing 1-8 units of reaction.
E.g., an unwashed robot could take an additional 2-20 HPS for 4 units after the initial blast.
Corrosive grenades are also known as acid baths, and Draino bombs.#

== 4) Cryoblast Grenade 

// insert table 480

The cryoblast grenade subjects everything in its area of effect to a blast of freezing cold.
The #grenade is not only capable of freezing things solid, but it can trap targets in the ice that it produces.
Medium, or smaller, sized targets have a % chance, equal to the damage inflicted, of being trapped in the ice.
So a medium sized beasty that took 19 points of damage would have a 19% chance of being frozen immobile.
The cryoblast grenade can also freeze swords in scabbards, render buttons frozen, #jam weapons, etc.
The cryoblast is also known as a cryofrag, a berg bomb, or a rinkmaker.

== 5) Energy Drain Grenade 

// insert table 481

An energy drain grenade will suck the life out of nearby potential energy stores (batteries), and then self destruct.
Any batteries within a 10 hex radius will be instantly devoid of charge.
The grenade will then shower a smaller 3 hex area of effect with its fragments, and kinetic energy.
This explosion will inflict 1d4 hit points in damage for every battery drained.
Therefore, if a hapless target has three batteries in her weapon, 4 in her backpack, and a nearby expedition member has a total of 9 on her person, the grenade would explode--in 0 to 3 units--inflicting 16d4 of damage to all within 3 hexes.#

The energy drain grenade cannot affect robot batteries, or power plants.
Psionic batteries get a save vs.
mental attack before losing a battery life.
The psionic attack strength of the grenade attack is 0.
Note that an energy drain grenade could kill a persona using psionic batteries by reducing her MSTR to 0.
#The energy drain grenade is also known as an Amp-ire grenade, or a Never-ready.#

== 6) Energy Grenade# 

// insert table 482

The energy grenade emits a controlled lazer explosion of the given volume (15h x 15h x 1h).
Regardless of the terrain in which the grenade is employed, it will always occupy the given volume.
Note that the 1 hex component will always run parallel to gravity.
The grenade's blast area will* *race along corridors, through open doors, around corners, and down escalators.
Using this weapon in unfamiliar terrain could have its effects hurtling directly back at the thrower.
The energy grenade is also known as an anti-trench grenade, or a mouser.#

== 7) Exploding Pin Grenade# 

// insert table 483

The exploding pin grenade is a rather sadistic version of a micro grenade launcher.
When an EPG goes off, it showers the 4 hex area of effect with tiny pins.
These tiny pins can stick into the hardest of alloys (AR less than 1000).
When ever #a pin hits, it will immediately explode inflicting the d6 damage described above.
The key is the number of pins which stick into a target, and this depends solely on the target's size.
Use Table 45.7, +++<i>+++Pin Hit +++</i>+++to determine how many pins will explode for #damage.

// insert table 484

== 8) Fragmentation Grenade 

// insert table 485

A fragmentation grenade is your common everyday run of the mill shrapnel grenade.
These are #commonly called frags, or grenades.

== 9) Fusion Grenade 

// insert table 486

A fusion grenade unleashes a micro nuclear explosion.
In addition to damage from the initial nuclear blast, there are a host of other nasty effects that increase the deadliness of the weapon.
Any flammable object within 15 hexes of the epicenter has a % chance (equal the damage of the blast) of immolating.
Anything ignited by the grenade will burn until extinguished.
Any organic creatures within 20 hexes of the epicenter not actively shielding its eyes will have a % chance (equal to 1/ 2 the blast damage) of being blinded for 1-10 minutes.
And lastly, any target within 30 hexes of the epicenter is subject to a radiation attack of an intensity equal to 1/10 of the blast damage (http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#saving-throw[See Saving Throws]).#

Any reader should have noticed that this is not a close combat weapon, and the even more observant readers have noticed that a fusion grenade cannot be thrown without having some effect on the attacker.#

The effects of a fusion grenade are cumulatively lethal.
Any target caught within the 10 hex radius would first take damage, let's say a modest roll of 60 hit points of damage.
Then there is a 60% chance a catching on fire, a 30% chance of being blinded, and then an intensity 6 radiation attack.
Only the most hardy of souls are going to survive this.#

For effect the ref can make the 10 hex area of effect a lingering radiation zone of an intensity equal to 1/10 of the blast damage.
The radiation #zone's intensity level will decrease by one point per hour, day, or week, depending on how dirty the grenade was.
Fusion grenades are also known as micro-nukes, and tactical nukes.#+++<figure id="attachment_9837" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9837" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i2.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Copy-of-stormy-storm-trooper-300x174.jpg?resize=300%2C174[Last Enemy by H.

== 10) Gas Grenade# 

// insert table 487

The gas grenade discharges a toxic combination of contact, and respiratory poisons in a dense enough mist to affect any organic creatures within it.
The cloud of gas will dissipate in 1-8 unit All targets must save vs.
poison attack for every unit that they #are within the area of effect.
Prevailing winds may affect the duration, and intensity of the gas cloud if the ref sees fit.
The gas's intensity will vary from 4-24 (4d6).
This value is generated once for the entire cloud, and will determine if it is a strong or #weak gas.

The type of gas ejected by the grenade can be rolled on Table 45.4: Gas Type+++<i>+++.
+++</i>+++This table will explain the gas'
effect on targets, and how long these effects last.#

// insert table 488

== 11) Gravruptor Grenade# 

// insert table 489

The gravruptor grenade generates 1-6 random gravities of anomalous attraction.
The effect will either smash targets into the ground, throw them high into the air, or fling them off into space.
The gravruptor grenade produces an instantaneous burst of random acceleration, and newtonian physics conveniently need not be applied.
Objects greater than 10 tonnes in wate are not affected by #this grenade's attack.

There is a 50% chance that the gravruptor grenade will add 1-6 +++<i>+++g +++</i>+++to the local terrain.
The effects of this should be obvious, as targets crash to the ground, weapons are torn from grasps, and vehicles grind into the dirt.
This pressing problem will also inflict damage to all targets in the area of effect.
This damage is 1 to 12 hit points in damage per extra gravity.
E.g., 3 gravities would smash targets into the ground for 3-36 hit points of damage.#

When the gravruptor grenade is reversing gravity there will be an acceleration of 1-6 gravities in a direction opposite to the present gravity direction.
The general effect is that things go flying into the air.
All items are lifted 1 hex in the air per anomalous gravity.
There is no damage inflicted on the initial toss up, but the subsequent trip down from 1-6 hexes will inflict substantial damage.
There will be 1-6 hit points of damage inflicted per hex that the target falls through.
If the targets #should hit a ceiling, or some other such covering, on the way up they would take 1 to 6 hit points per #gravity inflicted.

All of the above effects are described for a normal gravity world.
What effects this grenade has on high gravity and low gravity planets depends #entirely on the ref.

The effects of this weapon in zero gravity are described here because this is the environment that the weapon was primarily designed for.
All targets are subjected to 1 to 6 hit points of damage per gravity of acceleration, and fly away from the grenade's target hex at 1 h/u for every 2 points of damage.
So if a target in deep space took 5 gravities, inflicting 16 hit points of damage, she'd fly away at 8 h/u until stopped.#

The gravruptor grenade is also known as a downer, and a jump bomb.#

== 12) Magnetic Disruptor Grenade# 

// insert table 490

The magnetic disruptor grenade will generate a super attraction for a particular type of material.
Whatever the grenade attracts will hurtle towards the epicenter of the area of effect at very high speeds.
Nine times out of ten the grenade will #attract metals and alloys.
The remaining 10% of the time some other obscure material will be drawn towards the grenade (flesh, plastic, lumber, concrete).
If there is dispute as to whether a particular material is affected by the grenade then the referee and player should consult the highly technical and well researched http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#sphincter-dice[Sphincter Dice] described in chapter 16, Special Rolls.
For instance, does this grenade affect the weapons that the #opponents are holding?

This grenade can have lethal effects, since great big chunks of plastic, or metal, will be racing across the area of effect.
The referee must decide whether or not a persona is a potential target of flying debris.
If the grenade were detonated in a junk yard everyone would almost certainly take maximum damage from the flying material.
Deciding who is hit be the debris is determined by the referee.
How much damage is inflicted is #determined by the wate of the debris.

If a persona is hit by flying debris, she will take at most 20d4, and at the least 1d4 hit points in damage.
Magnetically attracted junk will inflict 1d4 hit points per hex per unit that it is travelling.
The wate of the object is divided into the arbitrary number of 20 h/u per kg, and this will determine how fast and how dangerous the projectile is.
A 2 kg projectile would inflict 10d4, and move at 10 h/ u.
A 20 kg object would harmlessly tumble along at 1 h/u, possibly inflicting a d4 of damage if it were to roll over a sleeping target.
Objects that are less than 1 kg in wate may move faster, but cannot inflict more than 20d4 damage.
Objects greater than 20 kg cannot move slower than 1 h/u, nor inflict less than a d4 of damage.
Objects which have a wate greater than 500 kg will attract the grenade instead of vice versa.
The user could employ this grenade to attract herself towards a space vehicle.#

A simpler way to determine the damage is each persona will randomly be subject to 1-20 (1d10) 1d4 in damage.

== 13) Mini Grenade# 

// insert table 491

Mini grenades are so small and light that they cannot be thrown far, and must hit the target to inflict damage.
Because they are so diminutive in size, mini grenade users may wish to throw a handful of these micro explosives at their target.
The persona can throw up to three mini grenades in one handful.
The first grenade attacks at minus 50, the second at minus 75, and the third at minus 100.
Remember that the grenades only need to hit the target, and not penetrate armour to inflict damage.
Mini grenades are also known as pea grenades, or pill grenades.
High tech mini grenades can become extremely small indeed.##

// insert table 492

*Mini Gas Grenades*:There is a 10% chance that a mini grenade will have the effects of a gas grenade, modelled after http://expgame.com/?page_id=337#10-gas[Gas Grenades, #10] in this chapter.
Mini gas grenades do no damage, but have an effect similar to one of the regular gas grenades.
The area of effect for the, mini gas grenade is no larger than the target hex in which it lands, and the attacker need only hit the target hex as with a regular grenade.
Any targets caught within this brief puff of gas need only make one save vs poison, since the cloud dissipates the same unit it appears.#

*Mini Pyrotechnic Grenades*:There is also a 10% chance that mini grenades will function the same as pyrotechnic grenades, modelled after Pyrotechnic Grenades, #18 in this chapter.
Mini pyrotechnic grenades do no damage, and function identically to regular pyrotechnic grenades in all respects.
The grenade user need only hit the target hex that the grenade is aimed at.#

== 14) Molecular Disruptor Grenade# 

// insert table 493

A molecular disruptor is a temperamental #disintegration grenade.
When it is discharged, it is capable of turning matter into a warm, seething cloud.
The problem is that neither the thrower, nor the grenade, has any idea how much matter is about to be disrupted.
Each time a molecular #disruptor is used Table 45.10, +++<i>+++Extent ofDisruption, +++</i>+++must be referred to to determine how devastating the effect is.#

The table +++<i>+++lists +++</i>+++both damage and disintegration values.
Damage is caused by thin slivers of #disintegrated matter, that punch microscopic holes through targets in the given area of effect, inflicting 8 to 64 (8d8) hit points in damage to all targets.
Disintegration indicates that all matter--this #includes personas--has been turned into an effervescent cloud of warm gas.
The effect of this on matter is devastating, and final.
Any organic creatures caught in a disintegration area of effect #will be killed.

The molecular disruption grenade is also known as a disintegration grenade.#

// insert table 494

== 15) Multiple Explosive Grenade# 

// insert table 495

The multiple explosive grenade is the exploding cigar of lethal combat.
This grenade is thrown and #will explode like any other normal grenade, but that is where the similarities end.#

Once the first explosion has discharged its deadly casing, the grenade is flung into the air, only to land and explode again.
The successive explosions will be 0 to 3 units apart, and 1 to 6 hexes in a random facet direction from the previous target hex.
There are three versions ofthis grenade, use the Grenade Pattern Table to determine which pattern is followed.
The radius of the area of effect, and the damage are listed for each of the grenade's multiple explosions.
^&#8211;^Such grenades are dangerous to the expedition because they can easily hop their way back to home ranks.
Unless properly identified, #

a multiple explosive grenade is indistinguishable #from a regular grenade.

Multiple explosive grenades are also known as jumping jacks.#

// insert table 496 + &nbsp;

== 16) Napalm Grenade 

// insert table 497

The napalm grenade is unique in that it has a swath area of effect as opposed to a spherical area of effect.
When the grenade is discharged, it launches itself into the air for an 8 hex trip while raining adhesive flammables all along its course.
Normally this grenade will launch itself in the same direction that it was thrown.
If the thrower is unskilled in grenade combat, and rolls less than 200 on her to hit roll the napalm grenade will launch itself in a random direction.#

Anything caught in this blazing area of effect will take the damage listed, will immolate, and will continue burning for 2-8 units.
The continued burning will inflict 2-24 hit points of damage each #unit.The 2 hex by 8 hex patch of flame will burn itself out in +++<b>+++1 +++</b>+++to 10 minutes.
Referees should also be prepared to consider the effects of smoke inhalation, which is unavoidable when this weapon is used in enclosed spaces.Napalm grenades are also labelled phosphorous grenades and Smoky the Fear bombs.#

== 17) Pin Grenade 

// insert table 498

The pin grenade is the needier of area of effect combat.
The pin grenade pierces everything in its 4 hex radius of effect with hollow pins.
In addition #to the damage taken from the shower of pins, each projectile can inject toxins stored in its head.
This means that organic targets will have to http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#saving-throw[make a]http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#saving-throw[save vs.
poison], or be affected by the attack.#

Consult Table 45.4: Gas Type to determine what kind of attack the pin grenade has.
A liquid pharmaceutical could also be placed within the holding well of the pin grenade.
There is a 20% chance that a pin grenade will not harbor any toxin #at all, and this means it can be filled with whatever toxin the persona has available.#

The intensity of the chemical will vary from 3 to 18.
The persona must make a saving throw even if a beneficial pharmaceutical has been placed in the pin grenade.
If the saving throw is successful the drug will have no effect.
This represents the randomness of dose that the target is receiving.#

The pin grenade is also known as a porcupine, or inoculator grenade.#

// insert table 488

== 18) Pyrotechnic Grenade# 

// insert table 499

Pyrotechnic grenades are smoke, sonic, and flash weapons.
These are not used so much as weapons, but as support devices for military maneuvers, or a magic show.
Pyrotechnic grenades come in any combination of the above, roll on Table 45.6 Pyro Combo__ __to determine the pyrotechnics#.

// insert table 500#

*Smoke*: A# smoke grenade does nothing more than fill the area of effect with very dense smoke.
The smoke will settle in 1 to 10 minutes.#

*Flash*:Flash grenades will temporarily blind any target that has optical sensors.
The sensors (eyes, cameras) will remain inoperative for 1 to 10 units.
There is a saving throw versus intensity 2 to #16 (2d8) poison.

*Sonic*: Sonic grenades have a lovely eardrum numbing boom that accompanies their discharge.
Any audio receptors in the area of effect will be rendered completely inoperative for 1 to 10 minutes, and ring- fer a good time after that.
There is a #saving throw versus intensity 2 to 16 (2d8) poison.

== 19) Radiation Grenade 

// insert table 501

The radiation grenade viciously douses its 12 hex area of effect with a variety of lethal radiation types.
Anyone caught in the bath area will take 3 to 18 HPS of damage, but must also save vs.
a radiation attack of an intensity equal to the damage rolled.
The attack will leave the area of effect radioactive for 3-18 days, or 1 day per intensity level of the radiation.
The radiation zone loses 1 degree of intensity each day until clean.
The radiation zone will always read anomalous to a radiation detector.
The radiation grenade is also known as a Neutron grenade, or a micrograve.#

== 20) Skylighter Grenade 

// insert table 502

The sky lighter is a truly outdoorsy type of grenade.
When it initially discharges, it inflicts no damage, and explodes straight up, disappearing into the sky.
2 to 6 units later all targets in the rectangular area of effect will be rained upon with piercing ice.
#This grenade depends on complex meteorological mechanisms which are useless if used indoors, in liquid free atmospheres, or in zero gravity.
The sky lighter grenade is also known as a painmaker, rainmaker, or chicken little bomb.#

== 21) Torc Grenade 

// insert table 503

The torc grenade does no damage to targets not contained within a force field.
Any force field that comes into contact with the area of effect of a torc grenade will be destroyed, and all occupants will take the allotted damage (12-144 hit points).
If the force field is less than 12 hexes in radius, the torc grenade will destroy it, and damage all targets with in it.
The torc grenade cannot knock down a force field greater than 12 hexes in radius, but every target within it will take damage.
The torc grenade will have no effect what so ever on force fields greater than 24 hexes in radius.
A force field powered by a renewable power plant will stay #knocked down for 1 to 10 minutes.
The torc grenade is also known as a force field #disruptor.+++<figure id="attachment_2052" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2052" style="width: 202px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i0.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/aerosol.317-202x300.png?resize=202%2C300[Ding.
