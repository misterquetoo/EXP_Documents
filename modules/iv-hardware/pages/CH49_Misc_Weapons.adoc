[.s3]#Miscellaneous weapons are the specialized high #tech weapons that do not fall into any of the other [.s3]#weapon chapters like bombs, guns, or grenades.
#[.s4]#The high tech miscellaneous weapons all have #[.s5]#some bizarre twist that makes them different from #[.s6]#the regular weapons.
Even though they are #[.s3]#specialized weapons, they are still designed to fit #[.s4]#into the combat system#.

[.s7]#Literally all but one of the devices are killing #[.s3]#devices, and using them will certainly result in #[.s8]#injury and death.
The referee should be very #[.s7]#cautious about introducing miscellaneous weapons into the campaign.
#[.s5]#The miscellaneous weapons have attributes like #[.s9]#all other equipment, and the explanation of #[.s5]#these stats is covered in the following paragraphs.#

== [.s1]#Type# {.p5}

Type refers to the weapon type that the gun falls into.
The separation of these weapon types is detailed in http://expgame.com/?page_id=300[Chapter 28: Weapons].
A type C weapon [.s2]#can make one attack per unit.
This means one #[.s1]#to hit roll every 2 seconds.
The delay between #[.s4]#attacks is due to items like weapon recharge, #[.s2]#weapon restabilization, re-aiming, or recalibration.#

[.s7]#When using the combat table, as in tactical combat#[.s2]#, all weapons in this chapter attack #[.s1]#as weapon type C.
This is the classification for #[.s2]#powered weapons.
All guns attack as weapon type #[.s6]#C regardless of whether their type is listed as type D, type E, type F, or Flotto.#

=== Letter Types {.p2}

[.s11]#Guns that recharge faster, are better #[.s2]#stabilized, or are easier to aim can fire more often.
#[.s7]#For example, type D attacks twice per unit, type E #[.s6]#attacks three times each unit, and type F attacks four times a unit.
Often a gun will have several #[.s4]#types listed like C, D, F.
This means that the #[.s12]#persona can set the weapon to make various numbers of attacks each unit.
This is usually #[.s2]#adjusted by trigger squeeze, or some switch setting #[.s6]#on the weapon.
Each attack requires a to hit roll.#

=== Flotto {.p2}

[.s5]#Flotto is a full auto feature where the weapon #[.s6]#releases at least 15 rounds in less than 2 seconds.
#This full auto burst yields 5 to hit rolls, where the [.s6]#persona can aim at any five contiguous targets in #her forward field of vision.
A hit will score 0 to 3 [.s8]#bullets on the target.
Each bullet that hits the #[.s6]#target will inflict the damage listed for the gun.
If a gun that inflicts 2-12 #[.s13]#HPS #[.s6]#of damage, hit with a full auto burst for 2 bullets, the attacker would roll 2d6 twice for damage.
The full auto is #[.s1]#a very lethal attack.
However, as the rapid fire #[.s2]#mode continues, the gun becomes more and more #[.s6]#difficult to control, and a cumulative to hit roll penalty of -30 is added for each successive to hit roll.#

[.s2]#The flotto attack can bog down combat for #[.s8]#inexperienced players.
The first thing to do if #[.s2]#combat is getting slow is to remove the -30 per to hit roll penalty.
If this doesn't work then replace #[.s6]#the 5 to hit rolls with a single to hit roll on one #[.s2]#target, that inflicts 1 to 11 bullets of damage#[.s6]# if it hits.
Deadly, but simple.#

== Range {.p4}

[.s7]#The range is the effective range of the #[.s9]#weapon.
This does not reflect the skills of the #[.s5]#persona in any way.
The weapon&#8217;s range is limited #[.s8]#by wavering bullets, dissipating charges, or #[.s4]#decaying material.#

[.s3]#If the range is listed as 120 hexes, -230 the #[.s7]#weapon has no to hit penalties up to 120 hexes, and #[.s5]#then a penalty of -230 to hit per hex beyond that #range.
This weapon would have -230 to hit a target 121 hexes away, and-460 to hit a target 122 hexes [.s7]#away.
Some weapons have a -1000 penalty for any #[.s3]#distance beyond their range.
This means that the #[.s4]#attack literally stops at that distance.
T#[.s9]#heatrical combat has no range penalties, #[.s3]#and any range effects are optional.#

== [.s1]#Damage# {.p9}

[.s5]#The damage is the range of hit points that can be #[.s3]#removed from a target when the weapon scores a #[.s12]#hit.
Type C weapons get no PSTR damage #[.s4]#adjustment.#

== [.s13]#Duration# {.p4}

[.s3]#Duration is the amount of use that #[.s7]#the miscellaneous weapon can withstand before its #[.s8]#battery charge is depleted.
The duration will #[.s5]#either indicate the number of units that the device #can be used for, or the number of uses, before the [.s4]#batteries must be replaced.#

== Wate {.p11}

[.s13]#Wate:#[.s3]#The wate is simply the wate of the weapon in kilograms, excluding batteries.
This value is #[.s7]#added to the persona&#8217;s wate allowance if she decides #[.s3]#to carry the weapon.#

== EXPS {.p11}

[.s9]#This is the amount of experience points #[.s14]#awarded to the user of the weapon, or whoever else, #[.s3]#identifies the weapon&#8217;s nature.
See chapter 15 in the rule book, Experience, for more info.#

== [.s3]#Value# {.p12}

[.s3]#This is the value of the weapon, if it #[.s9]#should ever be sold, or appraised.
There is no #[.s4]#guarantee that a miscellaneous weapon will be #[.s5]#sold for its correct worth.
The weapon value is not #[.s4]#just a monetary measure, but a measure of the weapons worth relative to other artifacts.#

== Miscellaneous Weapon {.p7}

== Type A Weapons {.p7}

[table id=754 /]

== [.s14]#Type B Weapons#

== [.s14]#1) Arm of Ephro# {.p49}

[table id=749 /]

[.s27]#The arm of ephro is a personal robotic combat #[.s9]#machine.
The device appears as a pole with a #[.s5]#spiked ball on each end.
The arm will befriend a #[.s8]#persona, and will join in combat against her #[.s3]#enemies.
The arm&#8217;s only drawback is its tendency #[.s4]#to jump the gun, and attack personas whom its #[.s3]#owner speaks harshly to, or threatens.
Whenever the persona gets angry or raises her voice there is a 2% chance of the #[.s5]#arm will go flying into action.
#[.s3]#During combat the arm fights in front of its #[.s8]#owner, and increases her AR by 75.
The arm #[.s5]#attacks twice per unit, has an AR of 900, and can #move at 10 h/u (via anti-gray).
Unlike other robots [.s3]#this one is destroyed when it reaches 0 #[.s31]#HPS+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++#[.s3]#The arm of ephro will start with 1d100 #[.s31]#HPS**.**#+++<figure id="attachment_5341" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5341" style="width: 208px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i1.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/blackhole.528-208x300.png?resize=208%2C300[Send more scientists to the black hole lab please.,208]](https://i0.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/blackhole.528.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5341" class="wp-caption-text">+++Send more scientists to the black hole lab please.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== 2) Black Hole {.p53}

[table id=751 /]

[.s3]#The black hole is quite unorthodox, but it is the #[.s5]#most deadly of all weapons.
The inactivated black #[.s4]#hole appears as a wheeled barbecue-like thing.
#[.s5]#When its lid is opened everything within a 1 hex #[.s3]#radius will be sucked into oblivion, disappearing like spiraling pieces of light.
Anything lost to a #[.s14]#black hole is lost from both time and space, and can #[.s5]#never be retrieved.[.Apple-converted-space]#  #Pretty serious stuff.
When the #[.s9]#hole is activated, it appears as a large blob of #[.s4]#blackness.
This makes it almost undetectable in #the dark.

There is some debate as to whether the black [.s5]#part of the black hole is the hole itself;
or the area #[.s14]#from which light cannot escape.
There are very few #scientists left who conduct such experiments.
The [.s9]#biggest mystery occurs when the black hole is #[.s5]#turned off;
because the barbecue stand-like thing gradually#[.s3]# reappears.
The creators of the black #[.s5]#hole have long since forgotten how this lid works, #[.s3]#and speculation has arisen as to whether it even contains a black hole at all.#

[.s4]#The black hole is under direct control of a #[.s3]#controlling device.
When the hole is contained in #[.s7]#the barbeque shaped super gravulator, it can be moved #safely at 2 h/u.
The wheels of the gravulator must [.s4]#contact the planet&#8217;s surface, and movement must #[.s5]#be programmed into the controller.
The controller #[.s7]#has 60 moves per battery set, and can store up to 5 #[.s3]#moves at a time (2 h/u);
otherwise the controller #[.s8]#must be programmed every second unit.
The #[.s5]#controller will have 10 buttons: open, close, and 8 #[.s4]#facet hex facings.
The deadly black hole is that #easy to use.

[.s3]#If the controller should be destroyed, or its #[.s5]#battery set run down, the black hole will rest where it is.
If the black hole happens to be left on, it will #[.s4]#repel the planet&#8217;s gravity such that its height off #[.s5]#the ground increases by 1 cm per day.
Ultimately leaving the planet&#8217;s atmosphere, to be lost forever.#

== [.s34]#3) Bullet Pen# {.p11}

[.s3]#[table id=752 /]#

[.s3]#The bullet pen is actually a normal pen.
It has a #[.s14]#steel nib, and an inkwell, it even writes very nicely.
#[.s5]#However, when the pocket clip is violently drawn #[.s4]#back, the ink ignites, firing the steel nib like a #lethal projectile.
In this instance the pen is mightier [.s4]#than the sword.#

== 4) Compucrafted Weapon {.p58}

[table id=753 /]

[.s8]#Compucrafted weapons are specialized non-#[.s5]#powered weapons which are better balanced, use stronger alloys, and are generally more lethal than #[.s9]#their normal counterparts.
#[.s7]#Compucrafted weapons will have a to hit roll bonus of +3 to 300, and a damage bonus of +1 to 8.
Thus a compucrafted sword could have a to hit roll #[.s5]#bonus of +120, and a damage adjustment bonus of #[.s3]#+5.
The higher the die rolls, the better the weapon #[.s4]#is designed.
#

The compucrafted weapon is  new and improved version of a mundane weapon type.
50% of the time it will be a non powered thrusting or striking weapon (type A) that has been compucrafted (see http://expgame.com/?page_id=345#type-a-weapons[Type A Weapon Table]).
The rest of the time the compucrafted weapon will be a non powered missile weapon, or a self powered missile weapon (type B/C).
To determine what kind of missile weapon it is refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=345#type-b-weapons[Type B Weapon] Table.
[.s4]#The weapon&#8217;s value is equal to its #[.s5]#normal cost multiplied by its accuracy (to hit roll #bonus)

== 5) Comm Blaster {.p57}

[table id=756 /]

The comm blaster will identify a specific radio transceiver and target it with an explosive pulse of energy destroying the target radio like a combined sonic and fragmentation grenade.
The explosion has a 2 hex radius.
The counter insurgency device can be used to neutralize threats that are communicating, or to dispose of compromised equipment.
The comm blaster does not work on lazer communicators.
Regardless of the communicator size the area of effect damage will be the same, and the radio will be destroyed.

== 6) Cutting Lazer {.p10}

[table id=757 /]

The cutting lazer is the robot slayer feared by all [.s3]#synthetics, women in powered armour, and any sane referee.
The cutting lazer emits a coherent #beam of organized light that slices through solid, [.s4]#inorganic matter, like a lazer slices through a #[.s3]#vacuum.
The mere twist of a persona&#8217;s wrist can #[.s5]#cut a hex-sized hole in hull metal.
What defense #[.s3]#does a referee&#8217;s scenario have against a cutting lazer (other than organic walls)?
Nothing.#

[.s5]#Honestly, an inventive player who&#8217;s persona has this weapon could solve most scenarios inside #[.s7]#of 10 minutes.
The only thing to do is to make the #[.s5]#weapon difficult to use.
The cutting lazer has 20 units of power, and every unit it cuts it will use a random 1-#[.s3]#12 units worth of this energy reserve.
The lazer cannot cut more than an 8 hex line per unit.
This #[.s14]#may be sufficient to complete the job, but when the #[.s5]#cutting lazer runs out of power no cutting can be #[.s3]#completed that unit.#

[.s14]#To have an effect the target must be hit by the #[.s7]#cutting lazer.
A cutting lazer gets a +250 to hit roll #[.s3]#bonus when being used against inorganic targets.
#[.s14]#A successful hit will simply cut something off.
The #[.s9]#persona need not roll to hit against prone, or #[.s5]#immobile inorganic targets.
The damage incurred #[.s3]#by inorganics should be at least catastrophic.
A #[.s5]#cutting lazer will inflict 100 to 600 (10d6 times 10) HPS of #[.s3]#damage to robots per successful hit.#+++<figure id="attachment_5342" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5342" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i0.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/displacementgloves.5301.png?resize=250%2C185[Getting in before the punch.,250]](https://i0.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/displacementgloves.5301.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5342" class="wp-caption-text">+++Getting in before the punch.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== [.s21]#7) Displacement Gloves# {.p67}

[table id=758 /]

The principal of displacement gloves is very simple.
[.s5]#A force field projects the damaging force ahead of #the incoming fist.
The displacement gloves change [.s3]#the range of the striking force after each attack, #[.s4]#making it difficult for the target to get familiar #[.s14]#with the device.
There is a +150 to hit roll bonus for #[.s5]#punches offered.
The bonus is due mostly to the #[.s7]#target&#8217;s confusion as opposed to increased accuracy.#

== [.s44]#8) #[.s1]#Electro Weapons# {.p71}

[table id=759 /]

Zappers are non-powered weapons with an added electrical charge.
[.s3]#The electro weapon attacks the same as its #[.s5]#base weapon type, but the electro weapon has an #[.s7]#added kick of +2 to 16 hit points of shock damage.
#[.s27]#When the battery charge runs out, an electro #[.s3]#weapon can be used as a mundane weapon.#

The electro weapon is  a shockingly improved version of a mundane weapon type.
75% of the time it will be a non powered thrusting or striking weapon (type A) that has been electrified (see http://expgame.com/?page_id=345#type-a-weapons[Type A Weapon Table]).
The rest of the time the electro weapon will be a non powered missile weapon, or a self powered missile weapon (type B/C).
To determine what kind of missile weapon it is refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=345#type-b-weapons[Type B Weapon] Table.

== 9) Expando Dagger {.p72}

[table id=760 /]

An expando dagger appears to be a normal dagger, but when it scores a hit thermally activated springs [.s5]#fire barbs into the target&#8217;s flesh.
It&#8217;s this shredding #that inflicts the extra damage.
The dagger can only [.s14]#be removed with a successful, normal (1d20) http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#attribute-rolls[PSTR]#[.s5]#http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#attribute-rolls[attribute roll].
Removing the dagger in this fashion will inflict another 4 to 24 hit points of damage.
#[.s7]#Seeing as the dagger is so difficult to remove, spies #[.s5]#love to use expand() daggers in conjunction with #[.s4]#poison.
Cooling an expando dagger can safely #[.s3]#release the weapon.
There is no autorelease and one stuck in is there to stay until it&#8217;s hilt is cooled.
#

== 10) Flare Gun {.p77}

[table id=762 /]

[.s7]#The flare gun is a pistol shaped survival device that #[.s5]#fires a geo-stationary  flare up to 100 hexes into the air.
The actual height off the ground can be determined by a dial on the flare gun itself.
If the persona wants the flare to be in a particular location in the sky a to hit roll should be made.
Once #[.s3]#aloft the flare is unaffected by normal strength #[.s5]#winds, and dutifully notifies potential rescuers of #[.s7]#the expedition&#8217;s location.
This is what it is supposed to do, but often the device will be used as weapon #instead.

[.s14]#A hit with a flare gun will inflict the expected #[.s3]#damage of 2 to 20 #[.s17]#HPS+++<b>+++.
+++</b>+++#[.s3]#The type and range of a #[.s5]#horizontally fired flare are listed for the #[.s7]#above.
There is a 2% chance per #[.s22]#HPS #[.s7]#of damage that #[.s3]#the flare will stick, inflicting a d6 in damage for every unit it remains stuck.
The flare will fall off of the persona within 1-20 units (unless removed #[.s5]#sooner).
If the damage kills the persona before the #[.s7]#flare is extinguished it will continue to burn a hole #[.s3]#directly through the body.
The flare gun must be reloaded after every use.#

== 11) Geo Drop Disk {.p79}

[table id=763 /]

The geo drop disk is a small metallic disk that acts as the center for an area of attack from outer space.
It does not elicit an alien invasion, but it calls on a surface strike from some exatmo orbiting death dealing device.
The drop disk is has two dials, one for area of effect (0 to 10 hexes) and another for time (0 to 30 units).
Once deployed the geo disk gravetically locks into place and brings down the rain.
The attack could be in the form of tiny pebbles hurtling at terminal velocity or a classic giant beam of destruction.
Regardless, anything within the chosen area of effect will be subject to major damage.
The geo disk is destroyed by the attack and cannot be moved once activated.

== 12) Grapple Whip {.p84}

[table id=764 /]

[.s9]#A grapple whip can be used as a regular whip, #snapping away for 2-5 of HPS damage per hit, or it [.s5]#can be wrapped around a target to inflict crushing #[.s9]#damage (the same to hit roll is required).
The #[.s5]#grapple whip must be successfully wrapped around #[.s8]#a target before it can begin to crush.
This is #[.s3]#represented by a successful to hit roll.
The initial grapple #[.s5]#hit will inflict no damage.
A second to-hit roll must #[.s14]#be made to ensure that the whip will stayed wrapped #around the target.
The second to hit roll is made at [.s14]#+100.
If it is successful it will inflict 4 to 24 HPS of #[.s3]#damage.
The attacker can then let go of the whip, #[.s7]#and it will contract and crush of its own volition.
No #[.s3]#more to hit rolls are required, and the constricting #[.s5]#whip will inflict 4 to 24 HPS of damage each unit.
#The maximum size of the target is 200 cm in [.s3]#circumference--medium sized and smaller.
#[.s27]#The grapple whip will contract until it is #[.s3]#released by the release button, until it is cooled drastically, or until it closes a loop (amputating #[.s5]#something in the process).
The hit location of the #[.s3]#grapple whip may be very important.#

[.s3]#A target won&#8217;t understand the significance of #[.s4]#the grapple until it starts to crush.
A successful #hard PSTR http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#attribute-rolls[attribute roll] (d30) can wrestle the [.s5]#grappling whip away.
The difficulty of the attribute #[.s3]#roll increases in difficulty each unit.
The grapple #[.s5]#whip can take 50 HPS in damage before breaking.#

== 13) Grenade Launcher {.p86}

[table id=765 /]

[.s5]#This is a pump activated, gauss powered grenade #launcher.
This device can be mounted on a rifle, or [.s3]#held like a pistol for the same effect.
The wate of #[.s5]#the rifle mount is 2 kg, and the paw held pistol is 4 #[.s3]#kg.
The grenade launcher can hold 3 grenades at once.
The grenade must have a wate between 0.5 kg and 2.0 kg.
The wate requirement can be less #[.s27]#stringent as the grenade launcher increases in #[.s5]#tech level.
The grenades are entered unarmed, but #[.s3]#they attack as normal grenades when fired.
This #[.s4]#weapon is pump activated, and requires batteries #[.s3]#to function.
There is a 5% chance that a grenade #launcher will come with a cache of grenades from http://expgame.com/?page_id=337[C][.s3]#http://expgame.com/?page_id=337[hapter 45: Grenades and Aerosols].#

== 14) Inertia Weapons {.p89}

[table id=766 /]

[.s9]#Inertia weapons drastically increase their wate #[.s7]#the moment they contact a solid surface.
This wate #[.s3]#change doesn&#8217;t affect their ability to hit, but when they do hit, they inflict lethal damage.
The base #damage per hit is 10 hit points, plus three times the [.s4]#base weapon&#8217;s normal damage.#

The inertia weapon is  a modified version of a mundane weapon type.
90% of the time it will be a non powered thrusting or striking weapon (type A) that has been inertia modified (see http://expgame.com/?page_id=345#type-a-weapons[Type A Weapon Table]).
The rest of the time the inertia weapon will be a non powered missile weapon, or a self powered missile weapon (type B/C).
To determine what kind of missile weapon it is refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=345#type-b-weapons[Type B Weapon] Table.

== 15) Lazer Bolos {.p72}

[.s7]#[table id=767 /]#

[.s7]#The lazer bolo is thrown like a heavy soft ball.
Soon #[.s4]#after it is released it separates into #[.s9]#two spinning semi-spheres, with a crackling, screaming #[.s3]#lazer connecting them.
A hit will normally do 3 to #[.s4]#18 hit points of damage, and the bolo will then slam #shut.
The lazer bolo will be too hot to use for [.s3]#3 units after throwing.
There is a 5% chance per #[.s7]#point of damage that the bolo will explode, inflicting #[.s5]#an additional 5 to 30 (5d6) HPS of damage.
If the bolo explodes I will automatically drop an anthro or smaller sized target.
If there is no explosion the hit target must roll to win versus a hard (1d30) DEX http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#attribute-rolls[attribute roll] or be tripped by the bolos.
The bolo #[.s3]#is destroyed when it explodes.
There will usually #[.s5]#be 1 to 8 lazer bolos.#

== 16) Light Sabers {.p76}

[table id=768 /]

[.s8]#Light sabres are energy swords which can be #[.s9]#retracted back into their hilts.
There are three #[.s5]#different kinds of light sabre, each having its own #[.s3]#damage, duration, and value.
#

[.s14]#Solid light sabres are very important for knites #The solid  light sabers are usually of unknown age, and there are a limited number in the known universe.
Any [.s3]#solid beam light sabre will have been previously owned by either a knite or anti-knite.
Touching a light sabre will award a bonus 1-1000 #[.s53]#EXPS #[.s3]#to a #[.s7]#knite.
However, if the previous knite fought for the #opposite side of the kirlian force the light sabre will [.s5]#also get one killing attack on the holder (whether charged or not).
This will only happen if the light #[.s4]#sabre is touched by a qualified knite.
Knites in #[.s3]#training can be profoundly influenced by touching a light sabre possibly even directing them from one side of the kirlian force to another.
If you have a knite in the party and they roll this miscellaneous weapon randomly then they should be given a solid beam light sabre.
That is being nice.
#[.s3]#Roll on Table 49.4: #[.s5]#Light Sabre Type to determine the strength of the #weapon.

[table id=769 /]

[.s55]#*1) Clear* (9000):#[.s3]#A clear beamed light sabre is #[.s4]#more of a force field club than a light sabre.
It #[.s5]#attacks like a blunt weapon, inflicting 2 to 12 hit #[.s7]#points when a hit is scored.
The beam is transparent, #[.s3]#and appears as a shimmering heat wave, although #[.s5]#it is not warm.
The clear light saber has a duration of 500 units per battery set.#

[.s56]#*2) Shimmering* (12000):#[.s5]#This light sabre&#8217;s beam #looks like an indecisive coloured wave of light.
This [.s5]#sabre has cutting ability equivalent to a sword, and #will inflict 4 to 24 (4d6) HPS in damage when it hits.
[.s9]#The shimmering light saber will last for 1000 #units per battery set.

[.s59]#*3) Solid* (priceless):#[.s14]#The solid, glowing beam of this lite#[.s4]# sabre is the true kirlian knite&#8217;s weapon.
#[.s5]#Each time this device attacks there is a 5% chance per point of damage of an amputating attack.
The amputating attack does no extra damage, but if the #[.s3]#knite makes a PT roll (DD = AR/100) a random body part will be excised from the target.
Use the #[.s5]#hit location tables to determine what is amputated.
#[.s3]#The light sabre is a clean weapon, and unless the #[.s14]#target is disemboweled or beheaded, the amputation #[.s4]#inflicts no further damage.
The solid beam light saber will function indefinitely as it is usually powered by the kirlian force of a full fledged knite.#

If you need a colour for the light saber use the Bomb Colour Table below.

[table id=436 /]

== [.s1]#17) Mash Net# {.p106}

[table id=770 /]

[.s5]#The mash net is a cousin of the grapple whip.
The mash net functions like a regular net, for shielding, but can also be used as a lethal entangling weapon.
A successful to hit roll will indicate that the target has been entrapped in the net.
In the first unit the persona cannot act in any capacity, and every unit after the first, the target will take 2 to 20 hit points #[.s7]#of crushing damage.
The net is composed of a high #[.s27]#tensile heat activated memory metal.
Once in #[.s5]#contact the net immediately begins to close and crush its victim.
The #[.s8]#net can only crush medium, or smaller sized, #victims.

[.s3]#The victim may make #[.s17]#PSTR #[.s3]#attribute rolls in an attempt to free herself, but the difficulty level #[.s9]#starts at hard (d30) and increases in difficulty every unit.
The mash net will keep contracting #[.s5]#until the persona is dead, and her body cooled, at which point the net re-opens.
The net&#8217;s contraction can be halted by immediate cooling.#

A common variation of the mash net will stop contracting as soon as the target becomes motionless.
If any effort is made to resist the net then it will continue to crush.
Hence this less violent version can be used to capture targets live as opposed to dead and macerated.

== 18) POV Shooter {.p86}

[table id=771 /]

The POV Shooter (pronounced pawv) does minimal physical damage but massive mental transformation.
If a successful to hit roll is made the target will take 1-4 HPS of physical damage from a psionic wave of compassionate transference.
A successful to hit roll includes a mental attack of intensity 1-10 (1d10) plus the attacker&#8217;s MSTR.
If the target fails this mental attack she will immediately adopt a complete understanding of the attacker&#8217;s emotional and personal position.
The results of this are temporary, lasting one unit per point of intensity of the attack.
Most victims of the POV shooter will have this epiphanous insight for less than a minute.

This weapon can be used in combat to neutralize threats who suddenly have the same emotional content of the attacker.
So a space trooper adorned in plastix armour may suddenly stop attacking the expedition.
In rare occasions the target may suddenly start to assist the carrier of the POV Shooter in combat.
This would be up to the designs of the referee.
Most of the time the target will sit perplexed and deeply contemplative possessed by thoughts other than the immediate battle.
There is a 1 in 1000 chance that the target may convert to follow the attacker due to their new found complete understanding.

The POV Shooter can also be an excellent negotiation or interrogation tool.
Giving vets and spies +24 when negotiating with a target.
Since the shock wave of compassionate transference does 1-4 HPS of damage it cannot be used in secret.

== 19) Rocket Assisted Weapons {.p86}

[table id=772 /]

[.s14]#These are rocket assisted non-powered (but powered #[.s5]#now) missile weapons.
The &#8216;arrows, boomerangs, #[.s3]#and daggers, are indistinguishable from regular throwing weapons until the micro boosters take #[.s5]#over.
The boosters are activated when thrown, and the weapon goes screaming through the air at its #[.s3]#target.
Rocket assisted weapons are launched as #[.s5]#normal Type B weapons, but the booster rockets #[.s3]#triple their range, and increase their damage (15 + #[.s7]#2 times damage).
The weapon type is rolled on the #[.s12]#http://expgame.com/?page_id=345#type-b-weapons[Type B Special Weapon] table found at the #[.s3]#beginning of this chapter.#+++<figure id="attachment_5343" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5343" style="width: 262px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i1.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/rocketlauncher.534.png?resize=262%2C201[For launching rockets.,262]](https://i1.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/rocketlauncher.534.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5343" class="wp-caption-text">+++For launching rockets.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== [.s7]#20) Rocket Launcher# {.p109}

[table id=1064 /]

[.s5]#The rocket launcher is a shoulder-mount directing #tube that unleashes a long range rocket.
When the [.s9]#rocket hits, it will inflict 6 to 60 hit points of #[.s3]#damage to everything in a 5 hex radius of effect.
#This is an area of effect weapon, and the firer only [.s8]#needs to choose a target hex.
If the device is #[.s4]#directed at a solitary target there is a to hit roll #[.s3]#penalty of -300 to hit, but a direct hit will inflict #[.s7]#triple damage on the target.
If a persona has rocket #[.s5]#launcher skill she will not suffer the -300 solitary #[.s9]#target penalty.#

The rocket launcher itself can hold 1-4 rockets for launching at one time.
So a rocket launcher holding 3 rockets could attack for 3 consecutive units before having to reload.
There is a back flash in the hex immediately behind the firer and anything caught within it takes 1 to 10 (1d10) HPS of damage.
The rocket launcher will malfunction with a kilodie roll of 40, or less.
A malfunction will occasionally indicate a premature rocket explosion.
The rocket launcher does not merely launch boring old shrapnel rockets, but can release any of a host of exotic warheads.
There is a 25% chance that the blast&#8217;s radius, damage, and effects will be [.s12]#determined by http://expgame.com/?page_id=337[Chapter 45: ]#[.s3]#http://expgame.com/?page_id=337[Grenades and Aerosols].
The rocket launcher is a #[.s9]#killing weapon, and the +++<i>+++Bomb Type +++</i>+++table is an #[.s3]#abridged list of the lethal grenades and aerosols.
It #[.s7]#is recommended that the referee use the +++<i>+++Bomb Type +++</i>+++#[.s5]#table in chapter 44, Bombs, to choose the rocket&#8217;s exotic warhead.#

[.s3]#The rocket launcher can also have a special rocket type.
There is a 42% chance of the rocket #[.s9]#launcher having a special rocket type.
Roll on #[.s5]#Table 49.5: Special Rocket Type if a special rocket is indicated.
The special rocket types are explained #[.s3]#in the paragraphs following the table.#

[table id=774 /]

[.s60]#*1) Autostrike* (5 000 000):#[.s7]#A special targeting sight #[.s3]#allows the firer to aim at solitary targets without the -300 to hit roll penalty.
A hit with the rocket #[.s5]#launcher will inflict triple damage (solitary target #[.s4]#damage), and a miss will still hit the target hex #[.s5]#(area of effect damage).#

[.s61]#*2) Crawl* (50 000):#[.s41]#The sight programs a #computer in the rocket.
The rocket hops out of the [.s3]#launcher and crawls along the ground towards the target at 25 h/u.
This helps it evade radar and anti-missile systems.
A to hit roll must still be made.#

[.s62]#*3) Decoy* (10000):#[.s4]#After leaving the launcher, #[.s9]#the rocket splits into d4 harmless decoys.
The #[.s7]#decoys will reduce the effectiveness of anti-missile #[.s3]#equipment by giving the attacker +100 to hit per #decoy.

[.s55]#*4) Delay* (25000):#[.s3]#A to hit roll is made and the rocket is launched.
It will arrive at the target hex #[.s4]#d20 units after it was fired.
The rocket takes a long #[.s3]#safe route, and can&#8217;t be shot down.#

[.s62]#*5) Memory* (750 000):#[.s4]#The target location is #[.s5]#photographed with a special sight, and the rocket #[.s4]#will remember the path from the target hex to the firing location.
#[.s5]#When fired #[.s7]#the rocket will go round corners, up stairs, stop and #[.s3]#wait for an elevator and then continue on to the #[.s9]#target.
It will follow the path of the launcher #[.s4]#exactly.
A to hit roll is required to ensure that #[.s5]#nothing accidentally gets in the way of the rocket.
#[.s3]#The rocket launcher can also be fired normally#

[.s55]#*6) Passenger* (5000):#[.s3]#The rocket can hold up to #[.s5]#1.5 kg of cargo.
The cargo will be protected inside #[.s7]#the rocket, and it will land safely at the target hex.
#[.s5]#Often the passenger will be a grenade, and it can #easily be rigged to detonate on landing.
This would [.s17]#be a DD2 mechanic maneuver, or a DD 12 mercenary #maneuver.

[.s64]#*7) Spaceship* (15 000):#[.s12]#This is a personal #[.s5]#spaceship mini-missile launcher.
This missile can be fired normally exatmo and inatmo.
The rocket #will be effective at damaging space vehicles if a to [.s3]#hit roll is successful.
Space vehicle mini missiles #[.s6]#are described in more detail in http://expgame.com/?page_id=320[Chapter 38:  ]#[.s3]#http://expgame.com/?page_id=320[Space Vehicle Combat].#

[.s65]#*8) Vehicle* (200 000):# The heat seeking missile can [.s3]#lock onto the heat signature of a vehicle, and will #[.s5]#hit in 0-3 units after firing.
A successful to hit must #[.s7]#be made.
The vehicle will be damaged as a solitary #[.s3]#target, and passengers as area of effect targets.#+++<figure id="attachment_5344" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5344" style="width: 246px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i1.wp.com/35.197.116.248/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/spinningwheelofdeath.535.png?resize=246%2C175[At rest.

== [.s3]#21) Spinning Wheel of Death# {.p67}

[.s7]#[table id=773 /]#

[.s7]#The spinning wheel of death appears to be nothing #[.s9]#more than a miniature card table with a crank.
#[.s3]#Sitting on the table is an oversized top.
The bulk #of the top is composed of razor sharp slats arranged [.s5]#like vertical venetian blinds.
The handle of the top goes through the table and is covered with horrid #[.s4]#needles and barbs.#

The spinning wheel of death must be cranked [.s27]#for four units before it can be released.
Once #[.s5]#released it will fly into the air, hovering for 1 to 4 #[.s3]#units.
During this time the device picks a target.
#[.s4]#The spinning wheel of death has a heat seeking #[.s3]#unit which will randomly pick a target from the #[.s5]#terrain on the opposite side of the crank (firer), and #[.s3]#then scream in for the kill.
If no targets are present #[.s9]#in the prescribed area, the wheel will attack a #random target on the board (yes, possibly even the [.s5]#firer).
Once a target is picked, the wheel gets a roll #[.s3]#to hit at +200.
Referee personas (aliens, etc.) are #[.s4]#automatically hit if the wheel chooses them.#

[.s5]#Damage from the spinning wheel of death is #[.s3]#first inflicted by the gnarly stem of the top as it grinds into the target.
The handle will burrow for #[.s14]#2-5 units, inflicting 4 to 40 #[.s66]#+++<b>+++HPS +++</b>+++#[.s14]#of damage each unit.
#[.s7]#When the bulk of the wheel (the venetian blind-like #[.s5]#slats) hits the target, the victim takes an additional #10 to 100 (10d10) HPS of damage.
Only then will the [.s5]#wheel grind to a halt.
Once it has stopped spinning #[.s4]#the flying wheel can be returned to its launcher #[.s3]#and used again.
Hit location makes no difference to the damage, but survival may be dependent on this.
Referee personas are automatically killed by this weapon.#

A reminder to referees is that important referee personas that contribute to the story or campaign milieu should not be automagically killed off by this device.
The spinning wheel of death is not a campaign killer.
Story before dice, and story before rules.

== 22) Stun Weapons {.p129}

[table id=775 /]

[.s9]#There is a 50% chance that the stun weapon will be a pair of stun gauntlets.
Stun gauntlets are the ultimate non-lethal #[.s3]#weapon.
A benign force field ensures the target receives no damaging forces, and at the same time #[.s4]#a central nervous system over-load is launched.
#[.s5]#The neural shock is capable of stunning the target.
#[.s9]#Any target hit by a stun gauntlet must save vs #[.s3]#intensity 3 to 18 poison or be stunned.
The target #[.s5]#will remain stunned for 2 to 12 minutes.
The stun #[.s3]#gauntlets appear as glowing gloves.#

[.s5]#The remainder of the stun weapons will be modified mundane weapons.
The stun weapons inflict regular damage, plus an #[.s3]#electrical shock designed to stun the target.
The #[.s9]#intensity of the poison attack is 2 to 20.
If the #[.s3]#persona fails the saving throw she is stunned for 1 to 20 units.
If the persona wishes to attack without doing damage she may use the weapon as a non-lethal attack, but the stun is still effective.
The persona can also elect to not stun a target and the weapon functions as normal.
75% of the stun weapons will be Type A weapons from the Type A Weapon Table.
The remainder will be type B weapons from the Type B Weapon Table.
If the stun weapon is type B (none or self powered missile weapons) there is no option for attacking non lethally.#

== 23) Transmogrifier {.p114}

[table id=776 /]

The transmogrifier is also called a &#8216;statuette.&#8217;
The device will convert a willing or unwilling target into a solid version of itself.
The statue is very life like in every detail.
The statuette transmogrifies the target into solid matter.
When the lever is pulled on the wheeled box the target gets a save versus intensity 3-24 poison or be turned into a statue.
If the target wins the saving throw she will take 3-18 (3d6) HPS in damage but avoids complete transmogrification.
If the target fails her saving throw the force of transmogrification will blast all of her clothing off leaving a perfect solid replica of the persona.
No damage is taken by getting solidified.
However when the transmogrifier is used to restore the persona she will take 2-12 HPS  of damage.

Typically this device is used as a weapon.
Freezing combatants out of the fight.
The process can also be used to freeze personas to protect them from poisons, locking them in stasis for long travel, or to hide them in a museum.
The statues must be treated with reasonable care.
If a limb is broken off while solid that limb will be off when re animated.
If the statue is destroyed the persona is dead.
Typically a statue will have 1000 HPS, but has no armour rating and any cutting or chipping tools would automatically work.

== 24) Temporal Disrupter {.p114}

[table id=777 /]

[.s9]#The temporal disrupter is a chrono accelerator #[.s3]#that causes any targets within the area of effect to age drastically and instantly.
The firer chooses a #[.s7]#target hex, and all within a 2 hex radius of effect are #[.s3]#aged 3 to 36 years.
This effect is permanent, and the targets will suffer what ever aging penalties would apply#[.s5]#.
Consult http://expgame.com/?page_id=267[Chapter 13: Health], for more information about these effects.
Referee #personas will also suffer 1 HPS[.s70]#* *#in damage per year [.s14]#aged.
This damage will be inflicted to those personas #[.s5]#where the long term effects of aging is unimportant.
This weapon damages both organics and inorganics.
#[.s3]#A malfunction will this gun will age everything in a 1 hex radius 3 to 36 years.#

== 25) Toss** **Garotte {.p137}

[table id=778 /]

[.s3]#The toss garotte is another hideous memory metal weapon.
It looks a lot like a pie-#[.s51]#plate without a center.
The opening is #[.s3]#approximately 25 cm in diameter.
The device is #[.s4]#generally placed over the head, and around the #[.s5]#neck in a surprise action.
The garotte can also be tossed at the target.
A hit with the weapon doesn&#8217;t #[.s4]#mean that it has sailed over the target&#8217;s head;
a #[.s14]#variety of things can happen.
A hit location roll will #[.s4]#determine what the garotte has wrapped around.
#[.s3]#It may have looped around a leg, over an arm, or even around the neck.
The torso is unaffected by #[.s9]#this attack.#

[.s5]#The garotte will quickly tighten inflicting 2 to #[.s3]#8 hit points of damage each unit.
The target will #[.s14]#lose consciousness after 5 units, due to pain, oxygen #[.s5]#deprivation, and nerve damage.
The device inflicts #[.s3]#no more damage after 5 units, unless the persona #regains consciousness.
The garotte will amputate whatever appendage it is wrapped around in a [.s3]#further #[.s14]#1-4+++<b>++++++</b>+++#[.s3]#units.
Cooling will release the garotte.#

[.s7]#The toss garotte cannot be freed by force rolls #since it quickly cuts into the skin.
The garotte can withstand 30 hit points in damage before breaking.
[.s5]#Any damage taken by the garotte will also be taken #[.s3]#by the victim.
The referee may give the persona #[.s17]#1 #[.s3]#to 4 toss garottes.#

== 26) Vibro Weapons {.p139}

[table id=779 /]

[.s9]#Vibro weapons are non-powered thrusting and #[.s4]#striking weapons which vibrate at an ultra high #frequency.
This aids both their ability to score a hit and to inflict damage.
Vibro weapons earn +100 on the to hit roll, and get +20 on damage.
The weapon [.s3]#type is generated on the http://expgame.com/?page_id=345#type-a-weapons[Type A Weapon Table],#

== 27) Web Gun {.p134}

[table id=780 /]

The web gun is a glue sprayer with a 1 hex area of [.s5]#effect.
A successful hit will stop the target in her #[.s3]#tracks by either gluing her down to the ground, or #by gluing all her limbs together.
The web gun will [.s3]#work on any target less than 750 kg in wate.
Only #[.s4]#a bizarre (d1000) #[.s14]#PSTR attribute #[.s4]#roll will free a webbed #persona.

[.s3]#The fine threaded glue will set after 0 to 3 units.
Anything passing through the webbed hex, #[.s5]#or touching the webbed target, before the web has #set will also get entangled.
Once the web is set and [.s3]#hardened the target is wrapped in a nice cocoon.
Once trapped in a cocoon only outside help may free the victim.
Chiselling, acid, or cutters will #make short work of the web, but the persona can&#8217;t [.s14]#move to free herself.
Saliva can loosen the web just #[.s3]#enough to breath.#

== 28) Whammer {.p139}

[table id=781 /]

[.s5]#The lazer frisbee is thrown more like a discus, from a specialized charger.
The lazer frisbee will return to its firer regardless of whether a hit is scored or not.
The whammer will return in 0 to 3 units, and #[.s14]#must be caught (easy DEX#[.s15]#* *#[.s14]#roll) by the persona.
The #[.s5]#whammer disk is recharged as the persona throws #it.
