[.s1]#Guns are weapons designed for lethal personal #combat.
They are designed to destroy targets with [.s2]#whatever means is available.
Guns are included in #[.s3]#the technology book because combat is, #[.s4]#unfortunately, an unavoidable aspect of most #[.s2]#exploration.
If our planet earth is any indication of how dangerous the universe is, then weaponry of #[.s5]#some sort will always be present.
If the unintelligent #[.s1]#wildlife doesn&#8217;t pose a threat to the expedition, #[.s6]#then malicious intelligent life forms will, and if #[.s7]#there is no threat to the expedition, then its members #[.s6]#will often fight amongst themselves.
It&#8217;s not that #the personas are so violent, it&#8217;s just that is [.s6]#what we can expect from the players ourselves.#

[.s7]#Getting back on track, the persona&#8217;s will want #[.s2]#weaponry to fight their battles.
The most popular #[.s5]#form of personal weaponry is the gun, and guns are #[.s7]#covered in detail here.
This chapter includes a host #[.s2]#of weapons from all manner of popular entertainment.#

[.s7]#The gun is rolled on Table 46.2: Gun Type+++<i>+++, +++</i>+++and #[.s4]#the necessary information for role-playing is #[.s6]#recorded by the referee.
Don&#8217;t be daunted by the #[.s1]#apparent volume of information to be recorded.
The essentials are damage, and ammo capacity.
#[.s5]#All other information is for combat connoisseurs of #[.s6]#varying degrees.
For instance, referees using the #theatrical combat system need only record the rate [.s5]#of fire, and the damage for a successful hit.
However #[.s8]#referees using the tactical combat system may #[.s2]#need to know the range and decay of the weapon #[.s6]#being used.
Only use the amount of information #[.s8]#that ensures play remains fun!#+++<figure id="attachment_5323" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5323" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i1.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/guns_unlabelled-300x213.png?resize=300%2C213[Not so obvious guns.,300]](https://i2.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/guns_unlabelled.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5323" class="wp-caption-text">+++Not so obvious guns.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== Type {.p2}

Type refers to the weapon type that the gun falls into.
The separation of these weapon types is detailed in http://expgame.com/?page_id=300[Chapter 28: Weapons].
A type C weapon [.s2]#can make one attack per unit.
This means one #[.s1]#to hit roll every 2 seconds.
The delay between #[.s4]#attacks is due to items like weapon recharge, #[.s2]#weapon restabilization, re-aiming, or recalibration.#

[.s7]#When using the combat table, as in tactical combat#[.s2]#, all weapons in this chapter attack #[.s1]#as weapon type C.
This is the classification for #[.s2]#powered weapons.
All guns attack as weapon type #[.s6]#C regardless of whether their type is listed as type D, type E, type F, or Flotto.#

=== Letter Types {.p2}

[.s11]#Guns that recharge faster, are better #[.s2]#stabilized, or are easier to aim can fire more often.
#[.s7]#For example, type D attacks twice per unit, type E #[.s6]#attacks three times each unit, and type F attacks four times a unit.
Often a gun will have several #[.s4]#types listed like C, D, F.
This means that the #[.s12]#persona can set the weapon to make various numbers of attacks each unit.
This is usually #[.s2]#adjusted by trigger squeeze, or some switch setting #[.s6]#on the weapon.
Each attack requires a to hit roll.#

=== Flotto {.p2}

[.s5]#Flotto is a full auto feature where the weapon #[.s6]#releases at least 15 rounds in less than 2 seconds.
#This full auto burst yields 5 to hit rolls, where the [.s6]#persona can aim at any five contiguous targets in #her forward field of vision.
A hit will score 0 to 3 [.s8]#bullets on the target.
Each bullet that hits the #[.s6]#target will inflict the damage listed for the gun.
If a gun that inflicts 2-12 #[.s13]#HPS #[.s6]#of damage, hit with a full auto burst for 2 bullets, the attacker would roll 2d6 twice for damage.
The full auto is #[.s1]#a very lethal attack.
However, as the rapid fire #[.s2]#mode continues, the gun becomes more and more #[.s6]#difficult to control, and a cumulative to hit roll penalty of -30 is added for each successive to hit roll.#

[.s2]#The flotto attack can bog down combat for #[.s8]#inexperienced players.
The first thing to do if #[.s2]#combat is getting slow is to remove the -30 per to hit roll penalty.
If this doesn&#8217;t work then replace #[.s6]#the 5 to hit rolls with a single to hit roll on one #[.s2]#target, that inflicts 1 to 11 bullets of damage#[.s6]# if it hits.
Deadly, but simple.#

== [.s14]#Range# {.p5}

[.s5]#The range is the effective range of the #[.s7]#weapon itself.
This does not reflect the skills of the #[.s6]#persona in anyway.
The weapon&#8217;s range is limited #[.s12]#by wavering bullets, dissipating charges, or #[.s6]#decaying material.
#[.s9]#If the range is listed as 120 hex, (-230): the gun has no to hit penalties up to 120 hexes, and then a #[.s6]#penalty of -230 to hit per hex beyond that range.
#[.s7]#This gun would have -230 to hit a target 121 hexes #[.s1]#away.
Some weapons even have -1000 for any #[.s8]#hexes beyond their range, this means that the #[.s6]#attack literally stops at that distance.
Theatrical #[.s8]#combat has no range penalties, and any range #[.s6]#effects are optional.#

== [.s9]#Accuracy# {.p20}

[.s2]#Accuracy very simply reflects the accuracy of the #gun.
The better balanced, and better designed, the [.s12]#weapon, the easier it is to hit the target.
The #[.s2]#accuracy attribute of a gun is simply added to the to hit #roll.

== [.s9]#Damage# {.p9}

[.s2]#The damage is the range of hit points that can be #[.s6]#removed from a target when the gun scores a hit.
#The more hit points removed, the more damage the gun inflicts.
The guns are given a range of damage [.s6]#that is randomly generated each time a successful #[.s2]#hit is made.
This randomness accounts for all the #[.s6]#unpredictability that is involved in tissue damage #[.s7]#and projectile physics.
This damage range is all the #[.s6]#damage that the gun can inflict;
type C weapons #[.s7]#get no damage adjustment.
When using the combat #[.s2]#table all powered weapons whether type C, #[.s16]#D, E,+++<b>++++++</b>+++#[.s2]#F, #[.s1]#or Special attack as type C weapons#

[.s2]#*Special*: If the gun&#8217;s damage is listed as &#8220;Special&#8221;, then #[.s6]#the nature of the damage is discussed in the gun #description, and it is usually complex or has some [.s6]#special effect (vaporization, death, etc.).#

[.s2]#*Calibre*: If there is a list of damages like 2-24, 2-20, 3-18, 2-16, and 1-15, then this gun has models with various calibres, or power levels.
The middle damage range (in this case 3-18) is the medium calibre attack and is the standard damage of the weapon type.
A gun with calibres will only #[.s4]#have one damage type.
For example, the first #[.s2]#damage range on the list inflicts the most damage, #2-24, it is the highest calibre (power level), and is [.s2]#called an extra high powered weapon.
The list goes #[.s7]#as follows: XHP, HP, MP, LP, and XLP.
See Table #[.s6]#46.1: Gun Calibre if the referee chooses to randomly determine calibre.#

[table id=529 /]

== Magazine {.p9}

[.s7]#The magazine of a gun is the maximum ammo #[.s6]#amount that can be found in the cartridge, or the #[.s2]#maximum number of attacks per battery set.
When #[.s6]#this number of attacks is exhausted, the persona must reload.
A gun with an ammo listing of 45 #[.s2]#could fire 45 rounds before the persona would have #[.s12]#to reload.
Referees should note that artifact guns are #[.s2]#rarely found fully loaded.#

== [.s9]#Malfunction# {.p9}

[.s4]#The malfunction stat is the #[.s6]#kilodie chance that the weapon has lost its attack #[.s8]#for one reason or another.
If the weapon has a #[.s2]#malfunction stat of 30, any to hit roll less than 30 #[.s1]#would indicate a weapon malfunction.
The lost #[.s19]#attack may be due to a dud shell, a battery #[.s20]#mischarge, or a mechanism jam.
Some #[.s7]#malfunctions have lethal effects for those standing #[.s6]#nearby the weapon.
The malfunction is checked #[.s2]#against the persona&#8217;s unadjusted kilodie roll.
The #[.s6]#referee should check any unadjusted kilodie roll less than 40.#

== [.s9]#Wate# {.p25}

[.s9]#The wate is simply the unloaded wate of the #[.s23]#gun in kilograms.
The wate of a gun can be #[.s2]#reduced, or increased, depending on the tech level #[.s9]#of the device.
If a list of three wates is given (4.62, #[.s7]#2.75, 1.95), then they refer to the different wates of #[.s6]#caliber weapons.
XHP, and HP use the leftmost #[.s2]#value (4.62), MP uses the middle value (2.75), and #[.s6]#LP, and XLP use the rightmost value (1.95).#

[.s1]#The wate of ammunition is included in brackets beside the gun wate.
#[.s6]#If there is no value listed to the right of the gun wate, then the gun uses batteries, and the battery #[.s12]#wate is added instead.
Batteries are rolled in http://expgame.com/?page_id=357[C]#[.s1]#http://expgame.com/?page_id=357[hapter 55: Support Equipment].
A set wate, like #[.s2]#20 gm, gives the wate of a complete cartridge.
A #[.s1]#percentage value indicates that the wate of the #ammo is a fraction of the wate of the entire gun.
For [.s6]#example, if a 2.5 kg gun had ammo listed as 1% #[.s2]#then one of its shells would have a wate of 25 gm.
#[.s1]#As a ref, I ignore ammo wate completely.
The #[.s7]#information is included for the purists, or for when #[.s6]#enormous amounts of ammo are being handled.
Remember only keep the data that makes the game more fun.#

== [.s9]#EXPS# {.p26}

[.s8]#This is the amount of experience points #[.s6]#awarded to the firer of the gun, or whoever else, #[.s19]#identifies the gun&#8217;s nature.#

== Value {.p26}

[.s7]#This is the value of the #[.s25]#gun+++<i>+++, +++</i>+++#[.s7]#if it should #[.s6]#ever be sold, or appraised.
There is no guarantee that a gun will be sold for its correct worth.
The value given that is in brackets indicates the value of the ammo, &#8220;b&#8221;
means that the ammo is actually a battery charge.#+++<figure id="attachment_5322" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5322" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i0.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/guns_labelled-300x201.png?resize=300%2C201[Obvious guns.,300]](https://i2.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/guns_labelled.png)+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-5322" class="wp-caption-text">+++Obvious guns.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== Gun Type {.p5}

Determine the artifact gun type by rolling on Table 46.2: Gun Type.

[table id=530 /]

== [.s9]#1) Aerosol Pistol# {.p38}

[table id=528 /]

[.s2]#An aerosol pistol amplifies some of the abilities of #[.s8]#targetable aerosols.
This pistol will double the #[.s6]#targetable range, and triple the number of charges #[.s7]#of an ordinary aerosol canister.
In no way does this #[.s5]#pistol alter area of effect, duration, or damage of an #[.s2]#aerosol.
Aerosol canisters cannot be disconnected #[.s6]#from the pistol until all charges are extinguished.
If an aerosol that has a range of 10 hexes and an #[.s5]#area of effect of 3 hexes were to be inserted into this #[.s2]#pistol, the aerosol would then have a range of 20 #[.s8]#hexes, the same area of effect, and it could be #[.s6]#ejected from the pistol 3 times.#

[.s5]#A malfunction indicates a loss of all remaining #[.s2]#charges.
There is a slim chance (determined by the #[.s6]#ref) of the weapon exploding on malfunction.#

== 2) Aerosol Rifle {.p43}

[table id=531 /]

[.s6]#An aerosol rifle enhances two of the abilities of #[.s12]#targetable aerosols.
This rifle will triple the #[.s6]#targetable range, and quintuple (five times) the #[.s1]#number of charges in an aerosol canister.
In no #way can this device alter the area of effect, duration [.s2]#or damage of any aerosol.
Aerosol canisters cannot #[.s8]#be disconnected from an aerosol rifle until all #[.s4]#charges are deployed.
If an aerosol that has a #[.s2]#range of 10 hexes and an area of effect of 3 hexes #[.s1]#were to be inserted into this pistol, the aerosol #[.s2]#would then have a range of 30 hexes, the same area #[.s6]#of effect, and it could be ejected from the rifle 5 #times.
[.s12]#A malfunction will indicate a loss of all #[.s19]#remaining charges.
There is a slim chance, #determined by the ref, that the weapon will explode [.s6]#on a malfunction.#

== 3) Antimat Pistol {.p47}

[table id=532 /]

[.s8]#An antimat pistol launches a micro particle of #[.s4]#antimatter suspended in a lattice of electrons.
#[.s1]#This lattice will shatter when it hits a liquid or #[.s12]#solid.
The resulting explosion will instantly #[.s6]#annihilate 50 kg of matter.
The explosion releases a blast of heavy particles and super-heated gases #[.s2]#that will affect everything within a ten hex radius regardless of cover.
Everything in the ten hex #[.s6]#radius will take 25 to 70 (5d10+20) hit points of #damage.
[.s6]#A malfunction with this weapon means the #[.s2]#electron lattice has shattered within the gun.
This #[.s6]#usually means a harmless misfire, but if the ref is in a bad mood the gun will disintegrate itself.#

== 4) Antimat Rifle {.p50}

[table id=533 /]

[.s1]#An antimat rifle is the long range cousin of the #[.s2]#antimat pistol.
The antimat rifle releases a larger #particle of antimatter, and causes a more powerful explosion.
The antimat rifle attack eliminates [.s12]#approximately 200 kilograms of matter.
The #[.s6]#resulting blast has a 25 hex radius inflicting 35 to #[.s7]#80 (5d10+30) hit points ofdamage.
In other respects, #[.s2]#the antimat rifle functions the same as an antimat #[.s6]#pistol.
More information is listed under gun #3, Antimat pistol.#

== 5) Beegun {.p21}

[table id=534 /]

[.s7]#The beegun&#8217;s activation chamber excites a normally #[.s2]#docile insect into a poisonous rage.
After two units #[.s1]#of warming up, the beegun is ready to fire as a #[.s6]#normal weapon.
If this weapon scores a hit, the #[.s7]#insect will inj ect a deadly and instantaneous poison.
#[.s1]#The hit victim must save vs.
intensity 19 to 24 #[.s6]#(18+d6) poison, or die.
If the target does save she #[.s2]#will be comatose for 1-4 days.
The ammunition for #[.s6]#a beegun is not reusable.
#[.s2]#A malfunction can only occur in the ammo of #[.s1]#this weapon.
If a malfunction occurs, a hit will #[.s5]#inflict 1 to 10 hit points of damage, but it will not be #poisonous.

== 6) Bolt Action rifle

[table id=535 /]

[.s2]#This is your normal hunting, or target, rifle.
This #[.s5]#weapon can also be called a pump action, revolving #[.s2]#chamber, steam, or pneumo rifle.
The medium powered bolt action rifle damage is 3-30 and its wate is 3.4kg, T#[.s2]#he other listed damages and wates are for higher and lower #[.s6]#calibers of this gun type.
A malfunction with this weapon is a misfire, and not a jam.#

== 7) Cryogun {.p10}

[table id=536 /]

[.s6]#A cryogun subjects everything along its path to #extreme cold.
Every target along the two by fifteen [.s6]#hex path will take damage.
The damage generated #is equivalent to the percentage chance of an object [.s6]#being trapped or frozen along the path.
If 15 hit #[.s2]#points of damage is rolled, there would be a 15% #[.s1]#chance of trapping a medium, or smaller, sized #[.s7]#object in ice.
There would also be a 15% chance of #[.s1]#freezing swords in scabbards, buttons in the on position, steering wheels straight ahead, etc.#

[.s6]#The chance of freezing must be checked for #[.s2]#each object.
The freezing effects of a cryogun will melt away in 6 to 60 units.
Heating will halve the #melting time.
Trapped targets that win a bizarre (kilo die) [.s40]#PSTR http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#attribute-rolls[attribute ]#http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#attribute-rolls[roll] can break free of the ice.
This weapon is also known as a frigidaire, or a cop gun (they don&#8217;t [.s2]#have to yell &#8220;freeze&#8221;
they just pull the trigger).
A #[.s6]#malfunction results in the loss of a charge.#

== 8) Death Ray {.p2}

[table id=1057 /]

[.s1]#The death ray pistol attacks the electrochemical #[.s6]#life force of organic creatures.
The beam attack #[.s12]#must score a hit to be effective.
Any organic #[.s1]#creature hit by a death ray pistol must http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#saving-throw[save vs.]#http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#saving-throw[poison] or die.
The intensity of the attack (3-24) is [.s1]#generated every time the weapon is fired.
This #[.s5]#weapon is also called a kill-o-zap gun or a terminator.
#[.s6]#The malfunction of this weapon will occasionally #[.s7]#call for an attack on the firer.
Normal malfunctions #[.s6]#result in the loss of all remaining charges.#

== 9) Derringer {.p10}

[table id=1057 /]

[.s2]#The derringer is a small compact and concealable #[.s6]#weapon.
It is composed mostly of plastic alloys, #[.s2]#and is coated with fingerprintless materials.
The derringer can be melted to nothing in less than 5 #[.s1]#units by submerging it in boiling water . When #[.s6]#being concealed this weapon will give bonuses of #+20 on sneaky PT rolls.
This weapon is also known as a family planner, or a Saturday night special.
A [.s7]#malfunction will jettison dud ammo and count as a #misfire.+++<figure id="attachment_9851" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9851" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i1.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pyrotomic_disintegrator_rifle-300x102.png?resize=300%2C102[Patent 170168 G.C.

== 10) Disintegration Gun {.p58}

[table id=538 /]

[.s6]#The disintegration gun is a very temperamental #weapon.
It is capable of boiling away large amounts [.s7]#of any liquid or solid that it hits.
The firer must first #[.s2]#score a hit, and then after that no one is sure how #[.s7]#much material will be destroyed.
The disintegration #[.s5]#rifle could boil away 1-100 (a deci die) kilograms of #[.s2]#matter, this amount must be rolled after every hit.
The more matter to be disintegrated, the less likely #[.s6]#the event will occur.
There is a 1% chance per kg #[.s1]#of destroyed matter that the attack will fail.#

[.s8]#Partial vaporizations, those hits where only a portion of the target is disintegrated#[.s6]#, will inflict 1-20 (#[.s31]#1d20) HPS #[.s7]#of damage per kilogram of material vaporized.
#[.s1]#Vaporization has no effect on adjacent objects #[.s2]#other than surrounding them in a colourful haze of #[.s6]#gas.
A failed vaporization will inflict a hefty 8-64  (8d8) HPS of damage.#

[.s2]#If an attack were supposed to disintegrate 27 #[.s1]#kilograms of matter then there would be a 27% #[.s6]#chance that the attack would fail.
If the attack did #[.s7]#fail, the target would take 8d8 hit points in #[.s6]#damage.
If the attack did not fail then the target #would either disappear completely (if its wate were [.s6]#less than 27 kg), or it would take 27d20 hit points #in damage.+++<figure id="attachment_9853" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9853" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i2.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pyrotomic_disintegrator_pistol-300x165.png?resize=300%2C165[Patent 168972 G.C.

Pistol version.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

[.s23]#The disintegrated matter must be semi-#[.s8]#contiguous, e.g.
a hit on the backpack, would #[.s6]#annihilate the backpack, and send its unharmed #[.s1]#contents clattering to the floor.
If the target has #[.s6]#been missed, but there is a chance that some piece of equipment has been disintegrated, it may be necessary to refer to the #[.s7]#hit location tables in http://expgame.com/?page_id=316[Chapter 36: Hit Location].
To #[.s2]#determine if items are contiguous can be done by rolling http://expgame.com/?page_id=275#sphincter-dice[sphincter dice].
#[.s7]#Very rarely will a malfunction of this weapon #[.s6]#result in its vaporization.

== 11) Electron Pistol {.p2}

[table id=539 /]

[.s2]#The electron pistol unleashes a blast of electrons #[.s5]#which damage the bonding ability of molecules.
An #[.s6]#attack from an electron pistol can pass through a #[.s1]#force field unaffected.
In fact, the attack of an #[.s7]#electron pistol will damage a force field and continue #[.s19]#on with its attack to damage the target.
An #[.s6]#electron pistol is also called a penetrater, or the chickenz surprise.
[.s2]#The medium powered electron pistol damage is 3-30 and its wate is 1 kg, T#[.s2]#he other listed damages and wates are for higher and lower #[.s6]#calibers of this gun type.

== 12) Electron Rifle {.p47}

[table id=540 /]

[.s1]#A minute organized beam of electrons massacre #the target&#8217;s molecules.
The beam has the ability to [.s1]#punch holes in force fields.
If a hit is made the #[.s6]#attack will damage both the target and the force #[.s2]#field#[.s12]#.
#[.s6]#[.s2]#The medium powered electron rifle damage is 4-40 and its wate is 4.0kg, T#[.s2]#he other listed damages and wates are for higher and lower #[.s6]#calibers of this gun type.
##[.s6]#A malfunction results in the loss of a charge.#

== 13) Fission Pistol {.p62}

[table id=541 /]

[.s5]#The fission pistol uses an energy wave to superheat #[.s1]#hydrogen molecules in its path.
Obviously this #[.s23]#weapon can only be used in hydrogen laden #[.s6]#atmospheres (air and water are good examples).
Charges are still drained if the weapon is fired in the absence of hydrogen.
This is one of the few #[.s2]#devices that will certainly be waterproofed.
Some cynics call this weapon a kettlegun.
Occasionally #[.s7]#malfunctions will indicate a backflash, resulting in #[.s2]#damage to the firer.#

== 14) Fission Rifle {.p10}

[table id=542 /]

== 15) Full Auto Lazer Pistol {.p10}

[table id=1058 /]

[.s6]#The full automatic lazer pistol is a standard hand #[.s1]#held lazer weapon with a rapid fire option.
#The &#8220;flotto&#8221;
setting indicates the automatic release of 15 charges in one unit.
The rules for special full automatic [.s6]#attacks are covered in beginning of this chapter #[.s1]#under http://expgame.com/?page_id=339#flotto[weapon type].

== [.s29]#19) Fusion Pistol# {.p69}

[table id=546 /]

[.s7]#The fusion pistol is an absolutely vicious weapon.
#[.s1]#When fired, it releases a micro blob of fusion #[.s5]#material.
The firer of this weapon will take 3-30 hit #[.s6]#points of damage from a fusion backflash.
This #damage will be inflicted every time the weapon is fired, unless the firer is wearing http://expgame.com/?page_id=3111[powered armour][.s5]#.
The fusion pistol has built in #[.s7]#shielding that will protect the firer, while absorbing #[.s5]#some of the gun&#8217;s charges.
When the fusion pistol&#8217;s #[.s2]#shielding is being used, the pistol only has three #charges.
The status of the shielding is determined [.s1]#when the batteries are inserted.#

[.s7]#The pistol itself inflicts substantial damage to #[.s2]#targets in two ways.
The first is getting caught in the fusion blob&#8217;s path.
This does not mean that #[.s6]#the persona has been hit by the superheated blob, but that it #[.s2]#passed near her.
The second method is getting hit #with the fusion blob proper.
For this to happen a [.s6]#successful to hit roll must be made.
No to hit roll is required to get caught in a fusion blob&#8217;s path, #and as long as the attack passes near the target she [.s6]#will take damage.#

[.s6]#All personas and equipment (including the #[.s2]#target) along the trajectory of the fusion blob will #[.s1]#take 6 to 60 (6d10) hit points in damage.
This #[.s6]#swath of heat damage affects anything within a one hex radius along the fusion blob&#8217;s path.
This #path of this damage is two hexes wide.
The fusion blob inflicts additional damage on the target if a hit [.s2]#is scored.
The amount of damage depends on the target&#8217;s size.
See Table 46.3, +++<i>+++Fusion Pistol Effects +++</i>+++#[.s6]#to determine how much damage the targets take.#

[table id=547 /]

[.s7]#Using the Fusion Pistol Effects Table it can be #[.s1]#determined that a hit on a medium sized target #[.s5]#would inflict 14 to 140 (14d10) hit points of damage.
#[.s23]#First 6 to 60 hit points from the heat of the #[.s2]#approaching blob, and then 8 to 80 hit points from the blob itself.#

[.s12]#If the target is tiny or small sized it will #[.s2]#explode if it is hit with a fusion attack.
Anything #[.s6]#within one hex radius of an exploding target will #[.s8]#take collateral damage from molten #[.s7]#shrapnel and boiling goo.
This means that anything #[.s6]#standing along the fusion blob&#8217;s path, and within #one hex of an exploding target (tiny or small sized) [.s6]#will take both swath damage and collateral damage.
#[.s1]#It should be immediately obvious that this #[.s6]#weapon has not been designed for close quarters #[.s27]#combat.
This weapon has been nicknamed #[.s1]#GVMB +++<i>+++(grossly +++</i>+++vicious meat burner), #[.s12]#party killer, or the BFG.
A malfunction will result in an #[.s7]#explosion inflicting 6 to 60 hit points of damage to everything within a 3 hex radius.#

== 20) Fusion Rifle {.p2}

[table id=548 /]

[.s6]#A fusion rifle is the big cousin of the fusion pistol,  #[.s20]#and it is an more vicious and #disgusting weapon.
When fired, it releases a micro [.s6]#blob of fusion material.
The firer of this weapon, and all within 1 hex will take 6 to 60 (6D10) HPS of #[.s2]#damage from a fusion backflash.
This damage will be inflicted every time the weapon is fired, #unless the firer is wearing http://expgame.com/?page_id=3111[powered armour][.s5]#.
#[.s1]#The fusion rifle has built in shielding #[.s6]#that will prevent the backflash, while absorbing #[.s12]#some of the charges.
When the fusion rifle&#8217;s #[.s1]#shielding is being used, the rifle only has three #[.s2]#charges.
The status of the shielding is determined #[.s8]#when the batteries are inserted.#

[.s2]#The rifle itself inflicts substantial damage to #[.s12]#targets in three manners.
The first is getting #[.s1]#caught in the fusion blob&#8217;s swath damage.
This does not #[.s6]#mean that the target has been hit by the blob, but #[.s4]#that it passed near her.
The second method is #getting hit with the fusion blob proper.
For this to [.s6]#happen a successful to hit roll must be made.
No #[.s7]#to hit roll is required to get caught in a fusion blob&#8217;s #[.s6]#path, as long as the target is standing within the swath&#8217;s area of effect.
The third method is to get caught within the area of effect of an exploding #target (collateral damage).

[.s1]#All personas and equipment (including the #[.s6]#target) along the trajectory of the fusion blob will #[.s8]#take 8 to 80 (8d10) HPS of damage.
This #[.s6]#swath of heat damage affects anything along the #[.s1]#fusion blob&#8217;s swath, which is 3 hexes wide.
This #[.s2]#fusion blob inflicts additional damage to the target if a hit is scored.
The amount of damage inflicted #[.s12]#depends on the target&#8217;s size.
See Table 46.4: Fusion Rifle Effects to determine how much #[.s1]#damage the target&#8217;s take.#

[table id=549 /]

[.s5]#Using the #[.s33]#Fusion Rifle Effects T#[.s5]#able it can be #determined that a hit on a large sized target would [.s2]#inflict 18 to 180 (18d10) hit points of damage.
First #8 to 80 hit points from the heat of the approaching [.s6]#blob, and then 10 to 100 hit points from the blob #itself.

If the target is tiny, small, or medium sized it [.s6]#will explode if it is hit with a fusion rifle attack.
#Anything within three hexes of an exploding target [.s7]#will take 8 to 80 hit points of damage from molten shrapnel and boiling goo.
This means that anything #[.s6]#standing along the fusion blob&#8217;s path, and within #one hex of an exploding target (tiny or small sized) [.s6]#will take 16 to 160 hit points of damage.#

[.s1]#It should be immediately obvious that this #[.s6]#weapon has not been designed for close quarters #[.s27]#combat.
This weapon has been nicknamed #[.s1]#GVMB (grossly vicious meat burner), the #[.s12]#party killer or the BFG.
A malfunction will result in an #[.s7]#explosion inflicting 8 to 80 hit points of damage to #[.s1]#everything within a 5 hex radius.#

== [.s1]#21) Gauss Pistol# {.p51}

[table id=550 /]

[.s23]#The gauss pistol magnetically hurls special #[.s11]#ammunition.
Each round has a sufficient #electrostatic charge to power the firing mechanism.
The magnetic force stored within the rounds cannot [.s1]#be harnessed for any other procedure, unless a #[.s4]#DD20 maneuver is completed by a mechanic.
#Magnetic attacks do affect this weapon.
It must be [.s7]#noted that this weapon is not silent.
#[.s2]#The medium powered gauss pistol damage is 3-30 (3d10) and its wate is 1.5kg, T#[.s2]#he other listed damages and wates are for higher and lower #[.s6]#calibers of this gun type.
[.s7]#A malfunction #[.s2]#indicates a mechanism jam (very, very rare).
##

== 22) Gauss Rifle {.p10}

[.s2]#[table id=551 /]#

[.s2]#With the above alterations noted, the gauss rifle is #[.s7]#the same as gun #21, gauss pistol.
It is not silent and enjoys a to hit bonus due to it&#8217;s minimal kick back.
#[.s2]#The medium powered gauss rifle damage is 4-48 (4d12) and its wate is 3.5kg, T#[.s2]#he other listed damages and wates are for higher and lower #[.s6]#calibers of this gun type.
[.s7]#A malfunction #[.s2]#indicates a mechanism jam (very, very rare).
##

== 23) Glass Gun {.p52}

[table id=552 /]

The glass gun sprays clouds of minute ceramic [.s6]#shards.
This weapon enjoys a +200 accuracy bonus #[.s7]#on to hit rolls against multi-pieced armour.
Some #[.s2]#examples of mulit-pieced armour are furs, leather, #[.s6]#padded, studded, ring, scale and chain.
This includes unarmoured targets or most alien hides#[.s2]#.
This weapon does not get its accuracy #[.s1]#bonus when it is being used against full piece #[.s5]#armour: robots, #[.s6]#powered armour, full plate armour, and vac suits.
#[.s1]#Each cartridge has its own power source.
#[.s5]#This power source can only be accessed by the glass #[.s12]#gun, unless a mechanic succeeds at a 20 DD #[.s2]#maneuver.
A malfunction indicates a mechanism #jam.

== 24) Grapple Gun {.p79}

[table id=553 /]

[.s7]#The grapple gun fires a cord that is attached to a very sticky blob (appearing as a bunch of grapes), #[.s5]#or a vicious metal barb.
The sticky thing does no #[.s7]#damage, but it will attach to anything that it hits.
The pointed barb will inflict 4 to 24 (4d6)  HPS of #[.s6]#damage, and has a 5% chance per hit point of #[.s5]#damage of sticking.
The grapple gun will have the vicious barbed format 60% of the time.
The grapple #[.s7]#gun has a built in winch that can pull 130 kg at up #[.s1]#to 3 h/u.
A grapple that is unattached can be #[.s7]#rewound at a speed of 6 h/u.
Unless a grapple is #under tension it can easily be removed.
Removing [.s29]#a pointed barb grapple will inflict a 1d4 hit points in #[.s7]#damage.
A malfunction with this weapon indicates #a mechanism jam.

== 25) Gravruptor Gun {.p10}

[table id=554 /]

[.s2]#This gun causes bizarre gravitational anomalies #on those targets that it hits.
Any target that is hit [.s5]#by the weapon will be subject to a blast of random #gravity.
The target gets no chance to negate the [.s7]#attack if the to hit roll is successful.
If the target&#8217;s wate is more than 500 kg it is unaffected by this #attack.
[.s7]#A hit with this weapon surrounds the target #[.s2]#with a random 1-4 gravities.
This unpredictable dose of acceleration will throw the target in a random direction.
Targets will take 1 to 12 (1d12) HPS#[.s5]# in damage per gravity regardless of whether #they hit a ceiling, wall, fall to the ground, or are [.s2]#flung off into space.
This gravruptor gun can inflict from #[.s5]#1-48 HPS of damage per hit.
There are #[.s29]#additional effects on a hit target and these depend on the atmospheric #gravity around the target.

The lower the gravity the greater the effect [.s6]#that the gravruptor gun has on its target.
The #[.s7]#range effects are doubled in 1/2 gravity situations #[.s6]#and quadrupled in 1/4 gravity situations.
For #[.s7]#instance a target would be knocked back 1 hex per #3 hit points of damage in 1/2 gravity.
[.s16]#The gravruptor gun is designed for zero gravity #[.s5]#combat.
It has no recoil to cause the firer any spin #[.s6]#problems, and sends those targets that it hits #[.s5]#flying off into space.
A successful to hit roll will still inflict damage for accelerating the target, and the #[.s29]#target will then fly away at 1 h/u per 2 hit points of #[.s2]#damage.
Thus a hit that inflicts 20 hit points of #[.s7]#damage would send the target racing off into space #at an uncontrolled movement rate of 10 h/u.
The gravruptor gun is also known as an [.s5]#accelerator rifle, or a gravgun.
A malfunction with #this weapon will result in a gravitational anomaly in the firing hex.

== [.s9]#26) Job Pistol# {.p38}

[table id=556 /]

[.s8]#The &#8220;Jack of all bullets&#8221;
(hence JOB) pistol is #[.s6]#capable of propelling almost any solid material as #[.s12]#a projectile attack.
The job pistol employs a #[.s6]#combination gauss, spring and vacuum chamber mechanism.
To inflict damage this gun must be #[.s27]#loaded with between 400 and 600 grams of #[.s4]#materials.
This random garbage (sand, rocks, #[.s2]#plastic, batteries, or bullets) will do 1-20 hit points #[.s6]#of damage if a hit is scored.
One battery set can hurl about 5 kg of junk (this is about 10 shots).#

[.s23]#This weapon is not a grenade launcher.
#[.s6]#Grenade launchers arm, and fire, a grenade.
Pre-#[.s2]#arming and then firing grenades inside a job pistol #[.s6]#can result in accidental detonation.
A malfunction #[.s2]#with this weapon indicates that garbage is jammed #[.s6]#in the firing mechanism.#

== 27) Job Rifle {.p2}

[table id=557 /]

The &#8220;Jack of all bullets&#8221;
rifle must be loaded with [.s1]#between 800 and 1200 grams of solid material.
#[.s4]#This material will inflict 3 to 30 (3d10) HPS of #[.s2]#damage, if it scores a hit.
The job rifle is good for about 10 kg of junk.
This converts to approximately #[.s6]#10 shots.
In all other respects this gun is identical #[.s2]#to the job pistol.#+++<figure id="attachment_9843" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9843" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i2.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lazer_pistol-300x178.png?resize=300%2C178[public domain image.

[table id=560 /]

[.s6]#The napalm gun ejects a jet of flaming adhesive chemicals.
The jet from the gun is covers a 19 by #[.s2]#1 hex swath area of effect.
The area of effect is a straight line, and cannot be swept over an arc.
Everything #[.s6]#caught inside the one hex wide path will take 10-100 HPS of damage.
All objects capable of #[.s7]#burning have a chance of bursting into flames.
The #[.s6]#percentage chance of immolating is equal to the #[.s2]#damage rolled.
If a target were to take 64 hit points #in damage, it would have a 64% chance of bursting [.s1]#into flames.
Targets that are set alight will burn #[.s6]#for 1 to 10 units.
Each unit of burning will inflict an additional 2 to 20 (2d10) hit points of damage.
This #[.s8]#weapon is also labelled the torch, bick, flame #[.s6]#thrower, or a cig weaver.
Usually, a malfunction #[.s8]#indicates a mechanism jam, but occasionally it #[.s6]#may cause the flame thrower to explode.#

== 31) Needler {.p90}

[table id=561 /]

[.s1]#A needier is a silent gauss pistol that launches #[.s6]#bunches of very sharp needles at high velocities.
#[.s1]#The needles can be coated in a variety of quick #[.s6]#release poisons.
If a hit is scored, a save versus poison must be made by the target, or the poison #[.s2]#will have its effect.
The poisons will only have an #[.s8]#effect on organic targets.
The poison effect is #[.s6]#determined on Table 46.6: Needler Effect+++<i>+++.
+++</i>+++The #[.s1]#needier is the weapon most often used used by #peace officers.

[.s2]#The effect of a needier attack is instantaneous, #[.s46]#and the effect of each attack is complete #[.s6]#incapacitation.
The poison effect will last for 1 to 4 minutes.
If the target saves versus poison there #[.s1]#will be no effect.
The poison intensity must be #rolled for every hit, this reflects the complexities of [.s8]#long range injections.
Each cartridge is a self-#[.s6]#contained unit, containing the needles, toxin and #[.s27]#battery source.
A malfunction results in a #[.s1]#mechanism jam.#

[table id=565 /]

[.s7]#A plastix pistol spits globs of molten plastix.
This #[.s2]#weapon was specifically designed for penetrating #[.s1]#plastix armour.
When attacking a target that is #[.s7]#wearing plastix armour the opponent is considered #[.s1]#unarmoured (AR 500).
Any hit scored on plastix armour, #[.s8]#will inflict double #[.s12]#damage.
The extra damage is taken from the #[.s6]#melting plastix armour.
The ammunition for this #[.s7]#weapon is a solid cylindrical cartridge that contains #[.s4]#both the plastix compound, and the energy to #[.s7]#charge the gun.
To employ the energy stored in the #[.s4]#cartridge for something other than the plastic #[.s2]#weapon, a 20 DD mechanic roll must be successful #[.s1]#A malfunction with a plastix pistol indicates a mechanism jam.#

Medical attention must be #[.s12]#accompanied with a cauterizing ray (medical #[.s6]#equipment #27), or a blood congealater (medical equipment #12), otherwise the veterinarian will suffer a +5DD penalty.#

[.s2]#This weapon is specifically designed to be an #[.s6]#anti-organic weapon.
Inorganic objects (robots, #[.s12]#walls, machines, Argellian rock women) are #[.s6]#unaffected by the attack since the disrupting ray passes through them unimpeded.
Walls, machines or robots that have organic components can be affected by this attack.
Inorganic armours have no effect on the #[.s7]#attack of a protein disrupter so the target&#8217;s AR, is #[.s12]#essentially 500.
Note that the firer must still #[.s2]#generate a to hit roll to ensure that a hit was made, #[.s7]#and to check for a weapon malfunction.
Malfunction #[.s8]#with a protein disrupter will inflict 1 to 10 hit #[.s6]#points to anything organic in the firing hex.#
