= Physical Strength (PSTR)

In short, physical strength represents the muscular brute force of the persona.
A more detailed look shows that PSTR is actually a combination of leverage, power and physique.
It is important to note that a persona with a high PSTR isn’t necessarily bulky or muscle-bound.
Shape is mostly determined by the persona’s family.
For instance, a wiry praying mantis can be a strong as a polar bear provided that their PSTR values were the same.
Muscle-boundedness is a reflection of low dexterity and is determined by the dexterity attribute, not the PSTR attribute.

== Wate Allowance

A persona with a high PSTR could lift heavier weights, be unaffected by a greater load and generally have greater strength than a persona with a lower PSTR.
Physical strength attribute rolls may be required for kicking open doors, breaking bonds, crushing beer cans or lifting weights.

The amount of equipment a persona can carry is determined by her PSTR wate allowance and picky referees may limit the persona’s equipment list to the nearest milligram.
The players should know their persona’s wate allowances to ensure they don’t ‘accidentally’ end up carting 3 tonnes of equipment across rickety suspension bridges.
This happens most often due to purely innocent oversight.
The finer details of how equipment mass affects movement is covered in Chapter 18.
Encumbrances.
