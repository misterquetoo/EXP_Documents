Ursidae is short for Hominidae Homo Ursus.
Ursidae are big, furry humanoid bears.
Common appearances of ursidae: grizzly, panda, black bear, etc.
They have rotund bodies, bear-like heads and claw-tipped stubby hands.
Regardless of the bear type chosen, the persona remains a bipedal humanoid that naturally possesses no more abilities than those described here.

== Hibernation
Ursidae can hibernate. 
The hibernation is so deep that they appear dead.
Their metabolism is so slow only vets and other ursidae can tell whether an ursidae is dead or just resting.
Ursidae will only hibernate when they decide to do so.
They will not automatically hibernate if they are knocked unconscious.
Ursidae cannot hibernate if the have negative hit points.
An ursidae with negative HPS is dying like all other anthro personas.

Once bedded down to hibernation the ursidae will sleep for 1d6  (1-6) days.
The hibernation duration is determined by the referee and is kept secret from the players.
While hibernating, the ursidae will heal 1 HPS for every 2 points of CON each day.
So an ursidae hibernating for 4 days with a 14 CON, would heal a total of 28 HPS.
Metabolic poisons have no effect on an ursidae while sheâ€™s in hibernation.

====
In past versions of EXP there was a chance that an ursidae could die during hibernation. 
Players would only notice when the persona started to smell bad. 
====

If players decide that they want to awaken an ursidae from sleep there is a 7% chance that it will work.
Regardless of the nature of the attempt the chance of waking is the same.
For instance, whispering softly into her ear will be as effective as inducing electric shocks.
Only one attempt to waken can be made per day of hibernation.

== Frenzy
In complete juxtaposition to hibernation is frenzy.
Frenzy is a mindless mauling attack where the persona drops everything and unleashes furry fury.
The persona rends and tears at the major cause of the dilemma with her claws.
She cannot hear anything and does not respond to commands, demands or screams.

=== Initiation
The persona can enter frenzy by choice.
An ursidae can also be forced into a frenzy if she is awoken from hibernation or intellectually stumped.
When intellectually stumped the persona has a 5% chance of forced frenzy.
When woken from her hibernation the persona has a 42% chance of forced frenzy.

=== Duration
Initially frenzy is good as the persona starts by attacking enemies or objects.
However the ursidae will continue to frenzy for the duration of the spell.
This could mean that fellow personas or valuable equipment becomes the target.
A frenzy will last for 2d8 (2-16) units.
The referee rolls the frenzy duration and keeps it secret from the players.

=== Effects
The ursidae will receive 1 and 1/2 attacks per experience level per unit.
This is rounded up. 
So a frenzied ursidae will get at least 2 attacks per unit.
The maximum number of attacks per unit is 6.
For example, a 4th level (regardless of vocation) ursidae would get 6 attacks per unit.

Each attack is either a punch, claw, bite or body slam.
These attacks are non-powered thrusting and striking weapon. 
The ursidae gets to use her Type A Bonus Proficient to attack.
No other bonuses can be applied in this primal state.
A successful hit does 1d6 HPS of damage.
She can add half her Type A Damage Adjustment to the 1d6 roll.
This flurry of furry turns her into a lethal killing machine.
For example, a 6th level ursidae with PSTR 18 would get 6 attacks per unit inflicting 10 to 15 HPS of damage per hit

Frenzied ursidae completely ignore their environment and their physiology.
No damage system shock (DSS) rolls apply during frenzy.
The frenzies persona will also continue to fight with a negative HPS total.
A frenzied ursidae will literally attack until dead.
