= Robots

Robots are the colloquial name for the family Machinae. 
Machinae are any life form that is inorganic and fabricated.
An organic fabricated life form would be an alien.
An inorganic non-fabricated would most likely be an alien.
Robots can be fabricated by Anthros, Aliens or other Robots.
It is possible for robots to be self replicating, but there would always be an original source.

Normal robots are not player personas.
Functioning robots follow commands and have no free will.
A functioning robot may be smart and sentient but it does not have consciousness.
Player persona robots are malfunctioning robots.
They have sentience, free will and consciousness.
From a robotic standpoint they are broken.

Robots are for players who want to try something different and challenging.
Robots are a challenging persona type because there is no organic frame of reference.
They have not basic humanoid form.
A robot may have wheels instead of legs.
A robot may have no appendages to manipulating artifacts.
Many actions a player expects her persona to carry out will not be possible with a robot.
The shape and lack of appendages makes robots more alien than aliens.

.Robots may work for you if
* You have a strong affinity for things mechanical.
* You have rapport with your computer, toaster or electric drill.
* You don't mind your persona never picking up an artifact.

If you are still here creating a robot player persona welcome aboard.
Robots are very mechanistic in their creation.
To ensure campaign balance the player has very few decisions in how the robot is generated.

.There are no robot storks.

== Attributes
Robots have the usual seven attributes. 
This includes AWE, CHA, CON, DEX, INT, MSTR, PSTR and HPS.
However the generation of these attributes is unique to robots.
There are four prime requisites:  CON, DEX, INT and PSTR.
The prime attributes determine the robotic type as well as her attributes.

Robot Control Factor determines whether a robot maintains its free will.
Fabricator Type may keep a robot from doing where her persona wants.
Neither is an attribute, but both are crucial to a robot persona.

Robots do not engage in the organic think space at all.
Robots have a MSTR of 0. 
Robots also do not have a social standing. 
If robots need to compare their privilege they would use their value.

=== Determining Prime Attributes
The player first generates the prime attributes.
The prime attributes are CON, DEX, INT and PSTR.
Each prime attribute is determined by rolling 1d4.
This value is called the level of the prime attribute.
Each prime attribute is recorded on the persona record.

A player that rolls a three for prime PSTR thus has a PSTR level of 3.
The true value of the attribute is generated from the attribute level.
The attribute level determines the robot type of the persona.
Attributes can change through out the game, attribute levels do not change.
The persona will  have four prime attribute each with a levels between one and four.
For example a CON level of 2, a DEX level of 2, an INT level of 3 and a PSTR level of 4.

=== Regular Attributes
Attributes amongst the families are equal in value. 
An INT 12 is equal amongst robots, aliens and anthros.
Prime attributes must be converted into regular attributes.
The prime attribute must remain on the persona record sheet.
For example INT would be recorded as INT level 2 INT 12.

// robot  assembly  Anthros building robots to replace anthros

== Robot Type
The player uses her robotic attribute levels to determine her robot persona type.
Determining robot type is byzantine, meticulous and painful.
This is why https://github.com/misterquetoo/EXP_Game_Tools[EXP Game Tools] were developed.
The game play reason for this challenging system is needed because robots are not balanced in power.
A heavy offensive combot is a force that cannot be reckoned with. 
In EXP personas are randomly generated.
Therefore extremely powerful robot types are rare.
If a player were playing a robot that could destroy an entire city she would likely be the center of the campaign.

TIP: Rules maintain game balance and assist creativity. +
*Do not let rules get in the way of the story or the fun.*

=== How To Use the Robot Determination Table
First, do not be afraid.
Second, it is as bad as it looks.

Each attribute level has it's own column. 
The player reads down each attribute level column recording the robot IDs in that column.
For example, going down the CON Level 3 column the player records *P* and *T*.
This process is repeated on for all 4 attribute levels. 
This will create a collection of letters. 
The most prevalent letter will determine the robot type. 
For example, if the total number of *H*s exceeded all other robot IDs the persona would be a hobbot.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robot_Type_Determination.adoc[]

Lets consider a bot named Sal.
Her attribute levels are CON 2, DEX 2, INT 3 and PSTR 4.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robot_Type_Example.adoc[]

.Running down each column yields the following IDs
* CON level 2 (C, D, I, M, S, V)
* DEX level 2 (D, E, I, J, M, R, S)  
* INT level 3 (C, H, M, P, R, S, V)
* PSTR level 4 (A, C, I)

Totalling the robot IDs there are 3 type C, 3 type I, 3 type M, and 3 type S
The player may choose between 4 robot types: C-Combot, I-Industrial, M-Maintenance, and S-Social.

// table insert 25

== Robot Type Fabrication Info
Fabricating a robot has a few of it's own unique elements. 
Attributes are generated differently.
The following attributes from the robot type must be recorded in order to generate the persona.
We will use the Datalyzer Fabrication Info as an example.

=== Heading
The heading lists the name of the robot type, it's ID, and a catchy blurb about it.
The ID is the letter in brackets.
The Datalyzer's ID is D. 
For convenience the ID is always the first letter of the robot type. 

=== Attributes
Information about attributes that define the robot or contribute to it's fabrication.

// the name primes will likely change 
==== Required Primes
These are the prime attributes that are required by the robot type.
They are NOT minimums they are exact numbers. 
So the Datalyzer must have a prime PSTR of 1 or 2.
A prime PSTR of 3 or 4 would not this robot type. 
The robotic primes and robot type selection is covered in detail at <<_robot_type,Robot Type>>

==== Attribute Minimums
A robot must convert its robot primes into regular attributes.
These regular attributes help select the robot sub type. 
A Combot has several sub types.
The persona's regular attributes would determine the sub type of combot.
For example a heavy offensive combot needs a PSTR of 27, not just a robotic prime of 4.
The Datalyzer has no sub types and therefore no attribute minimums.

==== Hit Points
Robot HPS are based on the persona's CON and robot type.
The calculation is listed for convenience and confusion. 
Detailed explanation of robot hit points can be found at <<_hit_points,Robot Hit Points>>

==== Adaptability
This is the bonus or penalty that a mechanic has to modify the robot. 
A positive adaptability is indicates a robot that can be modified more easily.
Some robots, especially combots, are resistant to being altered.

==== Size
This is a descriptor to indicate the size of this robot. 
Previously limited to indoor and outdoor sizes. 
This has been updated to indicate a range that is adjusted by CON and PSTR and type.
Very small and very large robots are not available to player personas. 
The Datalyzer is small sized which it is about half the size of an anthro

==== Value
The robot value is completely arbitrary and used for comparative purposes.
Robot value has no currency. 
The standard currency in EXP is the electrum. 
Value also doubles as the persona's social standing in the robot world. 
The value generated here is a base value which can increase with peripherals. 

=== Systems
The robotic systems are random abilities and items that are built into the robot.
They are different from adaptations added later.
Systems are baked in. 
Systems is a new approach in version 6.0.
These used to be called Attacks, Defences and Random.
The nomenclature has been rationalized.

==== Offensive 
This represents the chance that a robot will have an attack.
The attack may be a baked in weapon or a malfunctioning peripheral.
The table could say None, Auto, or a percent chance. 
The Datalyzer has a 5% chance of having an offensive system.
This would be rolled on table one in <<_offensive_systems,Offensive Systems>>

==== Defensive
This represents the chance that a robot will have an special defence.
The defence may be a baked in literal defence or a malfunctioning peripheral.
The table could say None, Auto, or a percent chance. 
The Datalyzer automatically gets one defense.

==== Peripheral 
This represents the chance that a robot will have an peripheral baked in.
Peripherals can be tools, adaptations, or skills that the robot has.
Typically these are not malfunctioning devices, but bespoke tools.
They can be magnificent or completely ridiculous.
The table could list None, Auto, or a percent chance. 
The Datalyzer automatically gets two peripherals.
The Auto is rolled on the Primary Peripheral Table.
The second roll is on the Secondary Peripheral Table.
See <<_peripheral_systems,Peripheral Systems>>


== Fabricator Type
There are no Asimovian Three Laws of Robotics in EXP.
Robots are free to smash up what and who they like.
There are some limitations though.
A robot can not wantonly harm persona from it's fabricator type.
This is the species that the robot was designed and manufactured for.
Almost all robots were fabricated by an anthro type.
In general a robot cannot harm their fabricator type. 
Nor would the robot allow her fabricator type to come to harm.
Every robot type, unless specified, follow this programming.

Robots can use non-lethal attacks, restraints, immobilization versus their fabricator type.
A robot would not simply allow itself to be destroyed. 
A robot will also protect a fabricator persona from other expedition members.
This is a major inconvenience that the player must get around when running a robot.

TIP: Rules maintain game balance and assist creativity. +
*Do not let rules get in the way of the story or the fun.*

Fabricator protection programming can be worked around. 
The more insane a robot is the more free will the robot has.
The more insane a robot is, the more flexible the application of this core programmed law.
A robot can justify deadly actions against her fabricator type.
The player would have to make a Control Factor Check.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Base_Anthro_Type.adoc[]

Most of the results on the Fabricator table are anthros.
If the player rolls anthro type equine her persona would protect and not harm equines.
Every other persona type needs to look out. 
Robots and aliens are crazy challenging.
Robots are recursively impossible. 
The referee may need to fabricate the robot fabricator or evolve an alien to fulfill the roll.

== Armour Rating
All bots have a base armour rating of 700.
It is important to note that armour rating values are the same for robots and all other personas.
A robot has no immunity from intentional damage because they are composed of special alloys.
A successful to hit roll will do damage to a robot as it would to any other target.
Robots are different from biological creatures and damage differently.
Want to know more? <<_armour_rating,Armour Rating>>

== Movement Rate
Robotic movement rate is determined by the robot's DEX attribute.

Robots are twice as fast as those personas with the same DEX.
Those bots which move faster than 8 hu, must accelerate the same as vehicles.
Robotic acceleration is one hex per unit per PSTR level (I-IV).

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Movement_Rate.adoc[]

A robot that has a 17 DEX and PSTR level of 3 would move 8 hu at first, 11 hu the next unit and then reach maximum speed of 14 hu in the next unit.
These cumbersome acceleration rules should only be applied in rare instances when the players have decided that picayune detail is of upmost importance.
Depending on the locomotion type, bots are affected by terrain just as regular personas are.
More information about robotic movement is covered under <<_locomotion,Locomotion>>.

// table insert 54

== Wate Allowance
Wate Allowance is the amount of wate that a persona can lift.
The implications of wate allowance are often ignored by referees.
Robots are affected by encumbrance similar to other personas.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Wate_Allowance.adoc[]

A robot with a PSTR level of 3 and a 17 PSTR would have a wate allowance of 75 kgs.
This means that the robot can carry 75 kgs before any movement penalties are incurred.
All penalties of encumbrance apply to robots as they would apply to other personas.


== Power Source
All bots operate on electrical power.
That electrical power comes from many different power sources. 
All cells work via ingenious advanced technological that is conveniently beyond explanation.
All robotic power sources are rechargeable.
Each power source functions equally well
The power source can go by many names: battery, cell, supercell, etc.

The robot's power source has will last one month per point of CON.
For convenience we assume that a new persona has a fully charged power source.
If the persona's CON drops then the duration of the power source drops along with it.
The robot's power source is proportional to it's use. 
No variations in use will drain the power faster or slower.

If a robot runs out of power, the persona will shut down until recharged.
The persona is not dead. 
It is just resting.
Robot personas will get a one month warning. 

It should always be made possible for a robot to recharge its power source.
Robot personas should not spend all their time searching for fuel.
One hour must be spent refuelling for each month of recharged.
Recharging could mean being plugged in, filling with water or being stuffed with materials.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Power_Cell_Type.adoc[]

=== Basic cells
Basic cells contain chemicals that react to create electricity.
One would hope that the nature of these chemicals is so advanced an explanation is optional.
For story telling purposes the chemical could be anything: natural gas, manure, hair, etc.
Recharging the power cell simply requires replacing the depleted materials.

==== Gas and Liquid Cells
Gas and liquid cells will cease operation if exposed to a vacuum.
This does not apply if the robot is exatmo hardened.
They will function as normal once atmosphere is restored.

==== Solid Cells
Solid cells function fine in vacuums, but do not function at high temperature.
Prolonged exposure to temperatures that may not damage the robot may damage its power cell.
Solid cells will function as normal once they cooled.
Extreme heat could destroy a bots solid cell.

=== Broadcast
Broadcast cells are power receivers that convert transmissions from a source into energy.
The receivers will cease to function if they are electronically jammed or out of range.
When within range the robot has an endless supply of power.
Robots using broadcast power can store one month of power per point of CON.
A robot with a broadcast power source that runs out of stored charge must be placed back in range to recharge.

=== Dynamo
Internal gyros spin up the electricity for this robot.
The countless dynamos are microscopic and silent. 
Cells offer no features beyond source.
Dynamos will not function when exposed to more than 2g.
The dynamos return to normal once gravity drops below 2g.
Dynamo cells can be recharged by plugging into the nearest electrical outlet.

=== Gravitational 
This power cell filters gravitational waves into electrical energy.
An explanation of this technological miracle will not be attempted.
The gravitational force cannot exceed 3g or be less than one half g.
The robot will store energy for those instances where gravitational cell cannot function.
The robot has 1 hour of stored energy per point of CON.
Once out of power the robot will remain dormant until gravity normalizes.

=== Magnetic 
Cellular magnetic forces are amplified to produce electrical power.
Magnetic cells will be disrupted by any magnetic based attacks or disruptions.
Severe disruptions may cause the cell to be demagnetized and require recharging.
This is left to the discretion of the referee.
Regeneration requires and electrical charge to re-magnetizes the power cells.

=== Nuclear 
The nuclear power sources uses slow burn fusion, fission, etc., to produce electricity.
It is impossible for a this persona to explode like an atomic weapon.
The nuclear cell is so efficient that there is no radiation hazard.
The nuclear power source functions in all many or atmospheres and gravities.
Fissionable materials are required to replenish the nuclear batteries.

=== Plasmoid 
Superheated gases contained in magnetic bottles fire up the robot for power.
This should make it virtually impossible for Mechanics to use the plasmoid cell maliciously.
The plasmoid cells have many safeguards that prevent their weaponization. 
Recharging plasmoid batteries requires the re-insertion of plasmodial materials.

=== Psionic 
Psionic cells convert the surrounding psychic energy into electrical energy.
The psionic cell has the most complicated recharge process.
The batteries last for the usual one month per point of CON.
When it is time to recharge the cell drains local psionic energy.
The nearest persona will to the robot will be drained one point of MSTR to fully recharge the robot.
The persona gets a save vs psionic attack. 
The robot persona uses her CON as MSTR to calculate the saving throw. 
If the persona saves the robot moves onto the next persona.
The process is automated and the robot is unaware of who is attacked when.

=== Solar 
The solar power source will keep the robot operational in any amount of light.
Artificial light and light from the nearest star work equally well.
If there is light this robot need not recharge.
If the robot should be plunged into darkness they will operate on stored power.
The robot can store 1 hour energy per point of CON.
A solar powered robot with a 16 CON could run for 16 hours in the dark.

=== Ref's Own Table
Referee can insert campaign related power sources as she sees fit.

== Sensors
All robots will have audio and video sensors which will allow the robot to hear and see.
The robotic audio and visual sensors function the same as any other persona.
To expect a player to manage otherwise would most likely be simply frustrating.
Robots do not have sensors for touch, smell or taste.
As with other personas the robot's AWE attribute is integral to the sensors.
Better awareness better sensors.
Sensors are only damaged when the persona's AWE is damaged. 
Robots will receive one additional sensor for every 4 points of AWE.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Sensors.adoc[]

=== Video
This robot has an extra set of video sensors.
These essentially act as an extra set of eyes for the robot.
These can be built into the robot's hull or conveniently attached to the end of an articulation.

=== Alternate optical
Alternate forms of optical vision include laser sights or ultraviolet/infrared detectors.
These types of vision can be included in the robot's regular vision or considered an extra component.
The alternate optical sensor allows the robot to easily see in darkness.

=== Vibrations
Vibration sensors convert molecular vibrations into comprehensible robotic vision.
This sensory feature will cut through any obscuring clouds of gas or particulate debris.
The maximum range of a vibration sensor is 5 hexes per point of AWE.
Vibration sensors are directional and the robot must look towards whatever she wants to observe.

=== Sonar
Sonar allows the bot to perceive a spherical area in the medium it is immersed in.
For instance, sonar will work equally well through air, water or smoke.
The sonar will not function beyond a transition between water and air.
The sonar range is 10 hexes her point of AWE.
Sonar cannot function in a vacuum.

=== Radar
Radar gives 360° vision around the robot.
This is a 360° disk and not a spherical area of detection.
This allows the robot to detect objects and determine their wate within 10 hexes per point of AWE.
Radar can penetrate solid objects.

=== Refs Own Table
Referee can insert campaign related sensors she sees fit.
Organic eyes, tentacles, olfactory unit, touch sensors, or a sense of style.

== Locomotion
This is how the robot moves around. 
Wheels, skis, balloons, tracks move the robot and define it's appearance.
Every robot rolls on the Primary Locomotion Table below. 
All types of locomotion perform equally.
So a robot with 3 pods would move equally to a robot with tracks. 
The persona's DEX score would be the difference not the locomotion type.

Some locomotion types require a complementary locomotion type. 
The complementary locomotion type  

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Primary_Locomotion.adoc[]


include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Secondary_Locomotion_Type.adoc[]

=== Antigrav
Antigrav is a classic science fiction term for anti-gravity.
The robot can travel about as though gravity has no effect upon it.
The robot can fly and flit about.
As ideal as antigrav is, it will only function within a gravity well.
The robot has no obvious mechanisms that create it's buoyancy in gravity.

Complementary antigrav only floats the robot, while the primary locomotion type moves the robot.
For example, a robot with jets and antigrav would float by antigrav and maneuver by the jets.
The antigrav jet driven robot would look like it is flying by jets, but would float with all jets off.

=== Chemical slide
The chemical slide allows the robot to effortlessly slide along any surface.
This process leaves a quickly evaporating trail not unlike a slug.
This comparison does not necessarily imply the bot will be slow.
A chemical slide will operate just as well up a slope as down a slope.
Sand, stairs and other difficult terrain may prove to be a challenge for a robot with this locomotive type.
How difficult such travel is depends entirely on the referee.

A complementary chemical slide is offering a frictionless surface and the primary locomotion propels it. 
For example, a robot with jets and chemical slide would stay grounded and be pushed around by jets. 

=== Electromagnetic legs (1d4)
Electromagnetic legs are visible beams the move the robot around.
A robot will have 1 to 4 electromagnetic legs.
These legs keep the robot about a meter off the ground. 
They keep the robot level on varying terrain.
Electromagnetic legs do not work on water.

=== Jets (1d4+1)
Robotic jets force gases at high speed to generate movement.
A robot will have 2 to 5 jets.
The jets create thrust and maneuverability.
Robotic jets are intake-less and do not eject dangerous super-heated propellants.
Whether jets work exatmo or not is up the referee.

=== Magnetic
A magnetic locomotion unit allows the robot to hover above the ground.
The height of the robot is fixed at no higher than 1 hex.
Magnetic locomotion is not a flying type of locomotion.
Robots with magnetic locomotion will often float around long after their destruction.
Magnetic locomotion can travel above any solid or liquid.

=== Pistons (1d10)
Pistons quickly poke up and down keeping the robot balanced and moving.
A robot has 1 to 10 pistons.
A single piston looks like a robot on a pogo stick.
The pistons are immaculately timed and keep the robot stable.
Pistons must have a solid surface to operate.

=== Pods (4d4)
Pods are articulated mechanical legs.
The robot has 4 to 16 pods.
These articulated poles will hop, scuttle or patter the robot about.
Pods require a solid surface to operate.

=== Propellers (1d6)
Robotic propellers are quiet, high-powered and safely encased air screws.
The propellers offer thrust and maneuverability to the robot. 
There are 1 to 6 propellers.
Propellers combined with antigrav would allow the robot to fly.
Propellers combined with a chemical slide would propel the slide.

=== Sails (1d3)
Sails are very sturdy, electro molecular planes that catch air for movement.
Robot sails operate perfectly well in raging wind or dead calm.
The sails offer thrust and maneuverability. 
All locomotion types are equivalent.
Movement is determined by DEX score. 
The robot will have 1 to 3 sails.


=== Skis (1d4+2)
Skis are attached to articulated pods that skate the robot over any type of terrain.
There are 3 to 6 (d4 plus 2) skis.
There is no difference in speed whether the robot is trotting uphill or sliding down slopes.

If the skis are a complementary Locomotion Type they do not function the same.
The skis are attached to articulated pods and not powered legs.
The skis would be the surface contact but jets, sails or propellers would drive the robot.

=== Slog bag
A slog bag appears as a fluid filled sack attached to the undercarriage of the robot.
The slog bag undulates and contorts itself along the surface the surface the robot travelling.
The slog bag moves like a sack of mercury, however it need not contain a liquid.
The slog bag cannot be during regular combat unless the robot's locomotion is damaged.

=== Tracks (1d6)
Robotic tracks are nothing more than rubber-coated tank tracks.
Each track is individually controlled and maneuvers by contorting itself.
There are 1 to 6 tracks.
This form of locomotion is rugged, although not especially familiar.

=== Wheels (1d12)
Robotic wheels are independently powered and controlled.
They are solid, puncture proof and 
There are 1 to 12 wheels.

When wheels are complementary locomotion type the Primary Locomotion Type generates the force.

=== Ref's Own Table
Referee can insert campaign related locomotion types as she sees fit.

== Offensive Systems
Offensive systems are attacks that the persona can use to inflict damage on targets.
This usually takes place in combat.
For a robot attack to inflict damage the player must make a successful to hit roll.
The vast majority of robot personas have no weapons at all. 

Most robotic attacks are *not* baked in weapons like guns or lazers.
The robotic persona attacks are more often malfunctioning devices.
The madness of robots allows them to use some baked in tool as if it were a gun or lazer.
Combots would be an example of a robot that would actually have a gun as a weapon.

****
A robot that has a sword attack is unlikely to have an actual built in sword.
The robot is more likely to have a shovel or dustpan, that is being used as if it were a sword.
****

Offensive Systems on the robot fabrication info table determines the type of attacks.
The higher the attack table the more deadly the attacks.
A robot fabrication sheet can indicate several different Offensive Systems.

.Offensive Systems Decode
Nil: No roll on Tables. Ramming only.

=== Ramming 
All robots can ram.
This is the robot's most basic attack.
Ramming is when the robot self-destructively flings itself at a target.
Ramming is not a skill that robots have.
This attack a self destructive exercise.
The player must make a control factor roll before her robot can crash into something.

NOTE: *All robots can ram!* +
_After a successful control factor roll._

To inflict damage while ramming, the robot must make a successful to hit roll.
The amount of damage depends on the wate and speed of the robot.
Ramming robots also take damage when they successfully hit with a ramming attack.
Robots that have Ramming Skill from Attack Table One as an attack can ram anything that they wish.
Robotic combat is detailed in xref:iii-combat_rules:CH31_Robotic_Combat.adoc[Robot Combat].

=== Attack Table One
A player gets as many rolls on Attack Table One as indicated.
For most robots these attacks are baked in devices that are being misused by the robot.
Attacks do not require a player to make a control factor roll to misuse them.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Attack_Table_One.adoc[]

==== Deadly Peripheral
This is the most difficult attack type for the referee to run.
She and the player must decide what peripheral the robot can use as an attack.
If time is of the essence or if the player is being particularly difficult in the arbitration, then the referee can ignore this roll and have the player roll again.

This attack type is difficult because there are no guidelines for damage, range, area of effect or range of the attack.
All of these parameters must be decided before the random ability is allowed to be used as a weapon.
Some examples of deadly peripherals are given as follows: An air conditioning unit that can attack like a cryo frag grenade but can also be used to maintain a comfortable atmosphere;
a photocopier that can be used to copy leaflets or flash at targets and blind them (saving throw granted).

****
An industrial robot with a gun and a flame thrower attack would have neither.
However it could be misusing it's nail gun and malfunctioning welding tool.
****

==== Type A Weapon
These are malfunctioning peripherals that can be used as weapons by the robot.
Type A weapons are thrusting and striking weapons.
The Type A weapon is rolled on Type A Weapons.
A flag pole could attack as a lance.
A rake could attack as a pike.
A nail hammer could be used as a head hammer.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Type_A_Weapon_Type.adoc[]

==== Ramming Skill
Not all bots are able to nonchalantly crash into objects.
Normally a robot must make a control factor roll before crashing into things.
Robots with Ramming Skill from Attack Table One can ram as they please.
A robot will only be able to ram opponents with a pre-determined section of its chassis.
This part will be considered the least vital and most able to withstand the repeated punishment.
Robots with Ramming Skill are not damaged when they ram score a hit.
Robots with multiple Ramming Skills can use each one per unit of attack. 

The shape and damage delivered by the robot part is determined on Ramming Type Table. 

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Ramming.adoc[]

==== Roll On Table Two
This result let's the player roll for a more dangerous attack on Attack Table Two.  

=== Attack Table Two
A player gets as many rolls on Attack Table Two as indicated.
For most robots these attacks are baked in devices that are being misused by the robot.
Attacks do not require a player to make a control factor roll to misuse them.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Attack_Table_Two.adoc[]

==== Two Rolls on Table One
The player gets two rolls on Attack Table One. 
This can result in multiple attacks.

==== Type B Weapon
Type B weapons are non-powered ranged weapons.
They are different from guns in that they are not as powerful.
Most are malfunctioning peripherals. 
The robot is ejecting or throwing something at it's target.
Arrows, daggers and bolts could be mail guns or staplers.
A shuriken could be tin can lids.
A staff could be a rolling pin.

The referee may limit the robot's type B attack by treating the attacks as ammunition.
A robot will contain 2 to 2000 (2d1000) charges for it's type B attack.
Some type B weapons are retrievable and do not run out.
These are weapons like axes or javelins.
A robot will have to 1-8 (1d8) copies of the retrievable weapon.
For example, a robot with 4 axes could throw 4 in a row and then must retrieve them.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Type_B_Weapon_Type.adoc[]

==== Nauseating Attack
The nauseating attack makes organic creatures feel unwell.
If the target fails a saving throw she will be incapacitated by head spinning vomit sensations.
As with other robot attacks the nauseating attack is most likely a malfunction of some sort. 
The robot may spray lubricants from a fractured joint or squirt industrial products onto targets.
The attack could also be electromagnetic waves or vibrations from broken peripherals.

The range of the attack is 1 hex per 2 points of PSTR.
The intensity of the attack is randomly generated each time it is activated.
Nauseating attack has an intensity of 3 to 12 (3d4).
If the target saves vs poison, the attack has no effect.
If the persona fails her saving throw, she will be incapacitated for 0 to 3 units (1d4-1).

==== Paralyzing Attack
The paralyzing attack makes organic creatures feel weak.
If the target fails a saving throw she will be incapacitated by weakened muscles.
As with other robot attacks the paralyzing attack is most likely a malfunction of some sort. 
The robot may spray lubricants from a fractured joint or squirt industrial products onto targets.
The attack could also be electromagnetic waves or vibrations from broken peripherals.

The range of the attack is 1 hex per 2 points of PSTR.
The intensity of the attack is randomly generated each time it is activated.
Paralyzing attack has an intensity of 3 to 12 (3d4).
If the target saves vs poison, the attack has no effect.
If the persona fails her saving throw, she will be incapacitated for 0 to 3 units (1d4-1).

==== Type A Attacks
Type A attacks are deadly malfunctioning robotic devices.
There are four different types energy, inertia, stun and vibro.
For example, this could be a rake that is accidentally electrified by a short circuit.
The player will need to jump back to <<_type_a_weapon,Type A Weapon>>.
The type A weapon will then take on the properties rolled on Attack Table Two.
These attack types (energy, inertia, stun and vibro) are from xref:iv-hardware:An_index_hardware.adoc[Hardware]

//add real link
To prevent further jumping around a list of each miscellaneous weapon is included below.

Energy::
The type A weapon is energized in some capacity.
Each hit scores a damage bonus of 2-16 (2d8) HPS of zapping damage per hit.

Inertia::
The density of this type A weapon is manipulated to increase damage delivery.
Each hit scores triple damage from the type A weapon plus an additional 10 HPS. 

Stun::
Through some mechanism of electricity or toxin a successful hit can stun the target.
The target must save vs intensity 3-18 (3d6) intensity poison when a hit is scored.
A failed save will leave the target stunned for 3-18 (3d6) units of combat.

Vibro::
This type A weapon is oscillating, undulating or vibrating it's way to extra damage.
Any to hit roll made with a vibro weapon has to hit bonus of +100.
If a hit is scored there is a damage bonus of +20 HPS.

==== Roll on Attack Table Three
This is getting dangerous.
The player rolls for an attack from Attack Table Three.


=== Attack Table Three
A player gets as many rolls on Attack Table Three as indicated.
These attacks are a mix of actual weapons and baked in devices that are being misused.
Attacks do not require a player to make a control factor roll to misuse them.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Attack_Table_Three.adoc[]

==== 3 Rolls on Attack Table One
Yup.
Three rolls on Attack Table One.
This can result in a lot of attacks. 

==== 2 Rolls on Attack Table Two
Yup.
Two rolls on Attack Table two.
This result in a lot of attacks.

If the target fails a saving throw she will be incapacitated by head spinning vomit sensations.
As with other robot attacks the nauseating attack is most likely a malfunction of some sort. 
The robot may spray lubricants from a fractured joint or squirt industrial products onto targets.

==== Type B Attacks
Type B attacks are deadly malfunctioning robotic devices.
There are four different types energy, inertia, stun and vibro.
For example, this could be a nailing gun that is accidentally electrified by a short circuit.
The player will need to jump back to <<_type_b_weapon,Type B Weapon>>.
The type A weapon will then take on the properties rolled on Attack Table Two.

Any to hit roll made with a vibro weapon has to hit bonus of +100.
If a hit is scored there is a damage bonus of +20 HPS.

==== Thermal Blast
A thermal blast can be extreme cold or heat that is ejected from the robot.
The player chooses whether the attack is hot or cold for her robot persona.
The attack has a range of 1 hex per point of DEX.
The thermal Blast must score a hit to do damage.
The attack is rolled as a Type B ranged non-powered weapon.
A thermal blast inflicts 1d6 of damage per point of PSTR.

// is this too dangerous
==== Corrosive Mist
A Corrosive Mist can an acid or alkali haze that is ejected from the robot.
The player chooses whether the attack is acid or base for her robot persona.
The attack has a range of 1 hex per point of DEX.
The Corrosive Mist must score a hit to do damage.
The attack is rolled as a Type B ranged non-powered weapon.
A Corrosive Mist inflicts 1d8 of damage per point of PSTR.

==== Gun
This is most likely an actual weapon built into the robot.
If a malfunction part that behaves just like a gun is preferred, story rules.
The player jumps to xref:iv-hardware:.adoc[Hardware]
Keep rolling on the gun table until a medium powered weapon or less is generated.
This means that no weapons that do not have a caliber, or energy level can be rolled.
Yes that is frustrating.
Robots do not express frustration.

=== Aerosol
The player can only roll for an Aerosol.
If a non-combat aerosol is rolled the player may roll again, keeping the non-combat aerosol as well.


=== Attack Table Four
A player gets as many rolls on Attack Table Four as indicated.
These attacks are actual weapons rather than baked in devices that are being misused.

include::ROOT:partial$CH05_Table_Robotic_Attack_Table_Four.adoc[]

==== Poison
Poisons are toxic substances that can have an immediate effect on organic creatures that are exposed to them.
The robot may spray lubricants from a fractured joint or squirt super cell by-products onto targets.
Some of the poisons may actually just be conductors that allow the robot to transmit radiations or electricity.
Poisons are sprayed onto targets and the range of the attack is 1 hex per 2 points of PSTR.
The target persona gets a saving throw versus poison and the poison toxicity (intensity) is randomly generated each time (4d4 intensity).
If the target saves, the killing poison will do 1d4 in damage per 2 points of intensity.
If the persona fails her saving throw, she will drop to -1 Hit Point and die soon after.

==== Gun
Refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=339[Chapter 46 Guns].
Any gun type that is rolled on the table there is built into this robot.

==== Grenade/Aerosol
Refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=337[Chapter 45 Grenades and Aerosols].
The player can make one roll on the table.
If a non-combat grenade or aerosol is rolled the player may roll again, keeping the non-combat aerosol as well.

==== Bomb
Refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=335[Chapter 44 Bombs].
The player can make one roll on the table.
If the player rolls a bomb it is detachable and remotely detonatable by the robot.

==== Jet
The blast or mist shoots forth from the robot with a range of 1 hex per point of DEX.
It attacks as a Type C ranged powered weapon.
A successful hit will do damage.
The Acid/Base Jet delivers 1d12 of damage per point of CON.

==== Mutation 
The player can roll one combat/attack mutation gleaned from Section IV Mutations.
The robot will have a physical mutation if the player rolls deci-dice (d100) less than her CON.
Otherwise the robot will have a mental mutation effect.
When a robots attack requires MSTR the robot will use her INT instead.
The mutation must be an attack mutation.
However if some other strange mutation comes along and the player can make it fit into the story of her robot, so be it!

==== Disregard Fabricator
This does not count as a roll on Robotic Attack table Four.
However it does allow the robot to attack her base family without having to make a control factor check.

==== Ref's Own Table
Look out world here comes something crazy.

== Defensive Systems

Robot defences are typically malfunctioning peripherals used as a defence in combat, or some kind of industrial hardening to protect the robot to do its prescribed task.
Occasionally robots defences are just that, a defence built to protect a robot from abuse.
Regardless of how the defences story is told the function of the defence is described here.
Each defence that the robot has listed under its robotic type earns the player one roll on Table 5.18: Robotic Defences.
For example an Interventional Medical Robot has a 10% chance of getting 1 roll on the table.
An Emergency Rescue robot has 3 rolls on the table automatically.

// table insert 67

*1) Anti-Missile*: This robot has an anti-missile system that is built into its hull.
This protective device will avoid damage from powered missile attacks likes guided bombs, missiles, grenades, rockets or directed aerosols.
The bots armour rating increases by 50 to 300 (50d6 or 1d6 times 50).
A failed to hit roll against this bot means that the missile is destroyed in its entirety and there is not area of effect or burst effect.
If a hit is scored only an area of effect can damage the bot.

*2) Anti-Personnel*: The anti-personnel device is designed to remove clamouring parasites or other organic creatures trying to grapple with the robot.
The mechanism of the anti-personnel device is chosen by the player.
Regardless of how it is described (electric shock, sonic attack, flames, shrapnel,  cotton candy webs) the effect is the same.
3d6 of damage is inflicted to all targets within the hex adjacent to the robot.
The damage is automatic.
Each target must make a saving throw versus pain (intensity equal to the damage delivered) or drop back from the robot.
This would allow the bot to move freely avoiding a swarm.

*3) Armour Rating Increase*: This indicates an increase in the base amour rating of the robot by 50 to 300 (d6 times 50).
The base AR of all robots is 700.
If one were to roll an AR increase of 250 then the base AR for this robot would be 950.
Repeat rolls on this defence will increase the robots AR each time.

*4) Artifact Armour*: The robot's regular body is replaced by a special armour type generated in http://expgame.com/?page_id=331[Chapter 42: _Armour_].
The base armour rating of the robot cannot fall below 700, and any special properties of the armour will be included in the bot's defence.
So the robot could be covered in relfec, ballistic, a force field or even powered armour.
Items that do no work, like helmets and shields should be re-rolled.

*5) Camouflage*: Often the best defence is being able to hide.
The exterior coat of this robot can blend in with the surroundings making it very hard to detect with the naked eye.
Any type of sensor that the robot has will allow it to camouflage against it.
So a robot with radar and video sensors could camouflage against radar and video.
This would make it essentially invisible to those types of vision.
Detecting this bot can only be done while actively searching and even then the searcher must make an AWE roll on a d100.

*6) Detect ambush*: Ambush detection allows the robot to quadruple its AWE when attempting to search out mines and other types of non-sentient ambushes.
A robot with a 12 AWE would have a 48 AWE searching for mines, trip wires or pressure pads.

*7) Diffuse Bombs*: This robot is a demolitions demolishing expert.
It can disassemble bombs and grenades as a 5th level mechanic and the bot can add twice its INT to the roll.
This defence can in no way assist the robot in planting bombs or making bombs.

*8) Evasive action*: Allows the robot to avoid combat situations entirely, providing it is not engaging combat itself.
This is essentially a computerized tactical withdrawal mode.
It allows the robot to move at normal through mine fields, tank traps, phalanx of soldiers and other such detriments to escape.
Each time the robot encounters an escape obstacle, it can avoid it with a d20 DEX roll.
No robot can attack while employing this defence (unless it is a combat robot).

*9) Force Field*: A robot's force field will absorb any HPS in damage that should be taken by the robot.
Once the field has absorbed its maximum damage, it will remain inactive for 1 minute per HPS absorbed.
A force field will be able to absorb 25 to 100 HPS in damage (d4 times 25).
Multiple force fields are added together and function as a single device.

*10) Increase HPS*: Increasing a robot's HPS increases the HPS total that it starts the campaign with.
A robot's HPS are increased by 10% to 60% (d6 times 10%).
A robot with 100 HPS and a HPS increase of 30% would have 130 HPS.

*11) Mental mutation*: This robot has a peripheral that has the same effect as a mental mutation.
The type of mental mutation is rolled in http://expgame.com/?page_id=364[Chapter 58: _Mental Mutations_] and it must be a defence mutation.
If the mutation is a defect, offensive or useless to the robot, then re-roll.

=== Override interrupt
The bot cannot be subject to robotic override.
This means that any device designed to control robots or make them subservient will not function on this robot.

== Peripheral Systems

Peripherals are attachments that give the robot some additional flexibility in performing its tasks.
These peripherals are non-combative and are used by the robot to survive day to day campaign trials.

The RANDOM listing under the robot type determines how many rolls the robot gets on the Table 5.19: _Robotic Peripherals_.
A listing of "`Normal`" indicates that the player can make one roll on the _Primary_ table.
If there is a single number listed under the RANDOM listing, then the player will make that many rolls on the Primary table.
If there is a percentage value listed, that is the chance that there is an additional roll.
If the robot type has Nil listed under RANDOM, then it has no random peripherals to start with.

The Table 5.19: Primary Robotic Peripherals is a list of harmless peripherals that are attached to the robot.
These peripherals cannot be used in combat and will not harm or damage anything in any way.
The robotic peripherals listed on the _Primary Peripheral_ table are ones which have a very limited effect on their environment.
Aroma producing could not be used to make a nausea attack, but it could help sell a house.
An articulation could not strangle an opponent but it could open a door.
There are no explanations of the particulars of the robotic peripherals other than the guidelines above.
The onus is placed on the player and the referee that the self-explanatory peripherals will not be abused.
Primary robotic peripherals will be a common reason to select Sphincter Dice from http://expgame.com/?page_id=275[Chapter 16: Special Rolls].+++<figure id="attachment_9608" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9608" style="width: 212px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[.size-medium.wp-image-9608] image::https://i0.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/lamps-albatross-212x300.png?resize=212%2C300[,212]+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-9608" class="wp-caption-text">+++Impress the natives with a light show.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

// table insert 68

Table 5:20: _Secondary Peripherals_ is quite different from Primary Peripherals.
These are peripherals and abilities that might not be explainable by standard programming hardware.
These robotic abilities are often the result of the synergistic effect of several damaged systems.
If a robot has some ability listed on the _Secondary_ table that is no indication that the particular robot type has that peripheral.
A relations bot may be amphibious but it does not mean that all relations bots are amphibious.
The robotic peripherals found on the _Secondary_ table are very briefly explained in single line sentences listed with each peripheral.
For the most part, these abilities are self-explanatory.

// table insert 69

== Description

The shape of a robot is only randomly determined if the referee and player have no preconceived notion of how the robot should appear.
The robotic shape has no bearing on any other robotic abilities be they attacks, peripherals or defences.
The robot can be shaped like anything the player wants: fire hydrant, filing cabinet, kitchen appliance, etc.
If you choose to let the dice decide roll on the following two tables below to get a basic robot shape.
For example a flattened cone, but colour, design, sound, decals, smell, chrome detailing is all left to the referee and the persona.

// table insert 70

// table insert 71

== Wate

A robot's wate will be determined by one of two factors: outdoor and indoor.
For robots that are designed to carry out hard work such as heavy lifting or construction, there is the outdoor wate equation.
Other robots that are not designed for such load bearing tasks use the indoor wate equation.
Regardless of the wate equation used, robots can function equally well both indoors and outdoors and only their wates will vary.

Further variation in robot wate can be attained from rolling the robot's tech level.
Tech level can be determined for any artifact in http://expgame.com/?page_id=359[Chapter 56: Tech level].
If the wate of a persona is ruining a perfectly good persona, then the value can be altered.
A robot can become lighter but NEVER heavier.
If a player wants her persona to look heavier, that is fine but the wate cannot be increased.

// table insert 72

== Size

Size gives a rough estimation of the volume occupied by the robot.
It is fine to keep things simple and just make one roll to give a hite similar to other personas.
The size roll will be used to determine what the bot can reach, fit into or be covered by.
Regardless of the shape rolled step 13 Description, the bot should  fit into the volume rolled here.
For example, a sphere with the parameters 1 meter by 15 cm could become a cigar.
Extrapolations for other shapes are usually just as simple.
If the dimensions rolled are very close, they may be rounded off to make a perfect shape.

Each player rolls dimensions three times: once for each of hite, width and length.
These can be arranged in whatever order works best for the personal.
If this table is ruining a finely formed persona then ignore it, but indication of the size of the robot is helpful.

// table insert 73

== Control Factor

CF is essentially a measure of the personas free will  
the higher the Control Factor, the more control the player has over her robotic persona.
If the CF is quite high, the bots personality is greatly affected.
The higher the bots INT, the higher the CF and the higher the CF, the better  
at least for the player.

*CONTROL FACTOR* (CF) = *INT* plus (*INT level* times *EXPS LEVEL*)

So a robot with an INT of 15 and INT LEVEL of 3 and was 3rd level would have a control factor (CF) of 24.

Robots were originally developed to do slave labour for the base family that they were designed for.
The robot personas controlled by the players are insane robots who don't care much for being slaves.
The more insane the bot is, the more it is like a normal player (generally not a very rational lot).
This insanity is relative.
These free willed robots are considered insane because they will look after their own self interest before they'll do their robotic duties.
An insane robot does not mean that the player must run her robot personal like a lunatic but that she can control her personal however she wishes.

The insanity level of the bot, or the amount of free will it has, is measured by its Control Factor.
The robot's Control Factor (CF) is the resistance it has to reverting to a normal functioning robot.
Whenever the robot is functioning as a normal bot, the persona has lost control of her persona.
When a janitorial bot starts cleaning up a room, it is functioning according to its internal programming and not the player's initiative.

*Control Factor Checks:* Control factor checks can be made whenever the robot performs a task for which it was originally designed.
For example, if a janitorial bot were to clean up a room or a combat bot were to kill something, a CF check may be in order.
If the CF check is failed, the bot will temporarily revert to being the automaton it was intended to be.
Players running robots should not be always rolling the dice to see if they lose control of their character or not.
The referee should only make her roll a CF check once in a while, perhaps when it is particularly crucial for the player to be in control of her persona.

Control factor checks are very similar to an adjusted attribute roll (see Chapter 16: _Special Rolls_).
The robot's CF is determined by the Control factor equation given above.
For instance: a 3rd level robot with a 14 INT would have a control factor of 17.
If the robot's INT drops due to damage, its CF will increase the amount of INT lost.
The more damaged, the more insane, the more free willed.

The player must roll under her control factor to maintain control of her robot persona.
Most control factor checks are made on a d20 and that is the smallest die that can be used.
More difficult CF checks may be made on d30s, d50s or deci-die.
If the robot with the CF of 17 were to voluntarily clean up a messy room (assuming it were a janitorial bot), the referee may require a d20 CF check.
If the robot were ordered to clean up a room by a charismatic member of its base family and if the persona giving the order was a Mechanic with robotic skill, the robot may have to make a d50 CF check.

*Loss of Control:* A failed CF check will indicate that the player has temporarily lost control of her persona.
This loss of control could be critical to the robot's survival and CF checks can often be life or death rolls.
The duration of the CF failure depends on the type of CF failure that occurred.
If the failure occurs during combat then it will last a random number of units determined by the die that tested the robot's CF.
So a robot failing a d50 CF check would become a referee persona robot for d50 units.
If the CF check occurs during non-combat then the personal will revert to being a robot for a random number of minutes determined by the die that tested the robot's CF.
So a robot failing a d50 CF check would become a referee persona robot for d50 minutes.

Modified HM.,300]

== Hit Points

Hit points for robots work the same way they do for other personas.
The major difference is that bots do not go unconscious when they reach zero hit points, nor do they die, nor can they be knocked unconscious nor can they heal their damage.
A hit point is a hit point regardless of whether it's a robot's or an alien's or an anthropomorph's.
The difference lies in how losing HPS affects the bot.
Old robots never die -- they just wear out.
This topic is covered under Robotic Damage in this chapter.

Each bot gets one HPS factor per point of CON.
An exploration bot (F) with a 20 CON would have 300 HPS and an analog bot (A) with a 4 CON could have between 12 and 16 HPS.

== Tech Level

The player should roll a http://expgame.com/?page_id=359[Chapter 56 Tech Level] for her robot persona.
This roll can adjust the wate and value of the robot.
A strange tech level could possibly make it more difficult to adapt a robot.
The tech level roll can make a robot lighter but it cannot make it any heavier.
If no tech level is rolled, the robot is assumed to have a tech level of 10.

== Adaptability

Only Mechanics can fit peripheral devices onto bots and this is done using the _Mechanics`' Performance Tables_.
The ADAPTABILITY is the percentage added to the Mechanic's PT roll, thus increasing the mechanic's chance for success.
The Degree of Difficulty of the particular procedure is determined by the ref.
Those bots with no adaptability percentage are designed to not be tampered with and instead of a PT roll bonus, the Mechanic suffers a 3 DD penalty.

== Value

The value of the bot is its base worth relative to all the robot types described.
The values indicated are for the basic unit that rolls off the assembly line.
The strange peripherals that may have just happened, or are added to the basic robot type, increase the robot's value.
Primary peripherals are worth about 10000 to 60000 each and secondary peripherals about 100000 to 600000 each.
The adjustment of the robot's base value is really up to the referee.
Any artifacts that are attached to the robot are tripled in value and added to the robot's value.
Robots that are worth incredible sums of money or have particularly valuable peripherals will often find themselves being greedily pursued by former owners or prospective "`buyers`".

== Robot Experience

As a bot gains more experience, it begins to solidify and reinforce its individuality and personality.
The robot becomes more insane as it gathers data moderated by its own free will.
The more individualistic and independent it becomes, the more insane it is.
Remember that insanity in a robot does not mean lunacy, just robotic free will.
Robots will gain experience by engaging in combat, taking damage and taking more damage.

5% of combat EXP's can be converted into data that will reinforce the robot's independent thought.
Nothing will increase the robot's free will more than damage.
Robots will earn 20 EXP's per HPS of damage they take.
Increasing a robot's level will increase its control factor and hence its free will.

Bots cannot acquire experience points for performing functions for which they were designed.
A domestic bot will not get experience for cleaning a room but will be rewarded if lucky enough to expose an informative fresco in the process of doing so.
A bot with painting skill would not be rewarded for painting a house but would gain experience points for using that same ability to spray paint into the eyes of the opponent.
So, novel use of a built-in skill will be rewarded with experience points.

== Robotic Damage

Many of the robot types seem to have enormous HPS totals.
This is because they need them.
Many attacks such as electrical and disintegrations do double damage and robots cannot repair HPS like other personas.
When a robot is hit, any damage it takes is subtracted from its HPS total.
Damage to a robot is the same as damage to any other persona.
A punch does no less damage to a robot than it does to any other biological life form.
The HPS still represents a universal value.
This means that a robot will quickly lost HPS and will be unable to heal itself.

The major difference between other personas and robot personas is that robots do not expire upon reaching zero HPS.
When a robot's hit point total drops below zero HPS, it is damaged and not dead.
Some random part of the bot has been eroded by some degree.
This erosion is represented by a drop in the persona's attributes, including the HPS total.

Regardless of the fashion in which the robot was damaged, the injured sub-system will be randomly determined.
This could roughly be considered the same as a hit location.
An attacker could damage a bot's sensors or power plan without even aiming for that specific part.
Each time the robot is reduced to zero HPS, another part is damaged.
Robotic death, the fatal malfunction, occurs whenever any of a robot's attributes is reduced to zero or its HPS max is reduced to zero.

*Losing Hit Points:* When a robot's HPS total does drop below zero, the robot has malfunctioned.
Damaging a robot reduces its HPS max by ten percent and randomly reduces another attribute.
The bot is then returned to full HPS max, less the ten percent.
For example: a bot with a total 110 HPS drops below zero;
the bot returns to the new HPS maximum -- which is less 10% of the previous one -- in this case, 99 hit points.
This new hit point total is now the bot's HPS maximum.
If this robot were to accumulate more than 99 HPS in damage, it would be damaged again and its new HPS max would be 89.
This process of diminishing returns is undergone each time the bot reaches zero HPS total.
So the robot's HPS max would continue to decline 80, 72, 57 etc.
until it reaches zero HPS max, at which point it is destroyed.

The easiest way to calculate this is to multiply the robot's present HPS max by 0.90 and round the result DOWN.
Always round the result down.

*Losing Attributes:* Robots may now seem indestructible.
They are tough compared to organic personas but they are far from indestructible.
Usually, long before the robot's HPS max reaches 0, the bot will suffer a fatal malfunction.

It is important to note that bots cannot heal any damage that they take and they slowly or quickly fall apart and break down until their sentience is no longer supported by their machinery.
In addition to losing 10% of their HPS max, the bot also has some specific system malfunction.
Depending on which system malfunctions, some of the robot's attributes will be reduced.
Whenever any of these attributes is reduced to zero, the robot is irrevocably destroyed.

The robotic part damaged is determined on Table 5.27 Robotic System Malfunction.
Every time the robot is reduced to zero hit points a roll is made on Table 5.27 as well as on Table 5.28 Robotic Malfunction Severity.

== Robot Decay Tables

The damaging continues until one of the personas attributes reaches zero and the bot dies.
How on earth does one keep track of this during combat without having everything grind to a halt.
The answer is to pre-roll the effects and create a robot decay table.
Consider the following Table 5.29 Robot Decay Table for Sal the Diagnostic Veterinarian Robot.
TTL keeps track of the total damage delivered over time.
Sal decays until her AWE reaches zero and dies.
