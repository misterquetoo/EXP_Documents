Robots are the colloquial name for the family Machinae. 
Machinae are any life form that is inorganic and fabricated.
An organic fabricated life form would be an alien.
An inorganic non-fabricated would most likely be an alien.
Robots can be fabricated by Anthros, Aliens or other Robots.
It is possible for robots to be self replicating, but there would always be an original source.

Normal robots are not player personas.
Functioning robots follow commands and have no free will.
A functioning robot may be smart and sentient but it does not have consciousness.
Player persona robots are malfunctioning robots.
They have sentience, free will and consciousness.
From a robotic standpoint they are broken.

Robots are for players who want to try something different and challenging.
Robots are a challenging persona type because there is no organic frame of reference.
They have not basic humanoid form.
A robot may have wheels instead of legs.
A robot may have no appendages to manipulating artifacts.
Many actions a player expects her persona to carry out will not be possible with a robot.
The shape and lack of appendages makes robots more alien than aliens.

.Robots may work for you if
* You have a strong affinity for things mechanical.
* You have rapport with your computer, toaster or electric drill.
* You don't mind your persona never picking up an artifact.

If you are still here creating a robot player persona welcome aboard.
Robots are very mechanistic in their creation.
To ensure campaign balance the player has very few decisions in how the robot is generated.

.There are no robot storks.
