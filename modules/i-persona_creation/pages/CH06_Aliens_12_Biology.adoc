= Alien Biology

All of the alien information up to this date is considered biology but the biology covered here represents superfluous information that will only subtly affect the nature of the alien;
whereas the previous biology represented factors that affect the attributes of the alien personas like movement, combat abilities, size, etc.

Biology gives a very brief description of where the alien fits into its ecological system.
The biome describes the terrain that the alien is accustomed to living in.
The last five tables provide some extra insight into what makes an alien tick.
They may seem trivial at first but can be very important under certain circumstances.
