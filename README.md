# EXP The game of technological chaos. 

Another attempt at asciidoc markdown static site.
This time using Antora.
While the concept of a static site generator is exciting and attractive execution proves very challenging.
Previous attempts were with Bolt, Grav, Hugo, Jekyll, and a few others. 
Antora is the one that leaves the documents the most pure. 
Pure as in I can use them anywhere else. 
Additionally the community around Antora is nascent and kind.
