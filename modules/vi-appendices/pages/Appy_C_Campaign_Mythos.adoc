= Appendix C1: Mythos

IMPORTANT: *Welcome friend of EXP. You are in an unfinished section of EXP. Please ignore.*

EXP has a generic mythos that acts as a framework for the sciency fiction fun.
This generic mythos is a loose affiliation of faux concepts and pseudo nomenclature.
These two non-existent descriptors are used to rationalize this science fantasy world.
This loose affiliation of ideas is supposed to make the game more fun. 

== The Spaces
The spaces are a faux concept with a pseudo nomenclature that defines where stuff is. 
The physical space is the one we mundanely live in. 
It is one we pretend to know the most about. 
The other spaces exist to allow us to defy reality in the physical space.
