Humanoids are also labelled Homo Mutabilis.
The humanoids are typically human shaped but they are atypically susceptible to mutations.
Players with humanoid personas may choose to have any skin colour they desire.

The humanoid family is a highly mutated version of pure strain human (PSH).
Like pure strain humans, humanoids include human types: Asian, Black, Caucasian, etc. 
Humanoid also includes: simians (monkeys, apes), suidae (pigs, boars), elves, dwarfs, orcs, etc.
None of these humanoid types have any of their mythical natural abilities.
Humanoids that resemble elves or leprechauns would have none of their mythical abilities.
The only special abilities they have would be the ones generated as mutations.
Homo Mutabilis has no remarkable abilities other than their extreme susceptibility to mutations.
