The class of mechanic encompasses all skills and knowledge of a technical nature -- whether it be electronic, mechanical, structural, etc.
They are generally good, handy people.
Their skills can range from laser technology to unclogging drains.
Unfortunately, they only have bits and bytes of rudimentary knowledge at their disposal.
Mechanics are especially beneficial to the expedition when artifacts need identifying.
They are essential if the expedition expects to repair damaged equipment or attempts to construct unique contraptions.

Examples of mechanics from popular media include Scotty (Star Trek), The Professor (Gilligan's Island), Q (James Bond), Brain (Escape from New York), and Bicycle Repair Man (Monty Python).

*Abilities*:  The mechanics have some special abilities related to their class that other personas cannot attempt.
These are different from skills in that the persona can call on them in any capacity.

*Mnemonic Trapping (d8 DD)*:  Using finely trained memory skills the mechanic can memorize addresses, instructions, serial numbers, or procedures for later use.
The referee can adjust the degree of difficulty of the maneuver depending on the complexity of the sequence or its length.

*Brainstorming (d20 DD)*: This ability allows the mechanic to solve complex problems by relating incongruous pieces of information by thinking laterally and by thinking imaginatively.
If the brainstorming attempt is failed, the persona will most likely come up with a hair brained idea instead of no idea at all.
The effect of this ability can be to solve a problem completely, partially, or to earn a PT roll bonus of 1 to 4 DDs.
Brainstorming can be limited by the referee and its degree of difficulty adjusted as needed.

*Mental Patenting (Triple DD)*:  The mechanic can memorize a maneuver that she has successfully completed in such a fashion that she can repeat the maneuver flawlessly.
If upgrading a certain item is a DD4 procedure, she should mentally patent this maneuver (DD12) and repeat it flawlessly on future occasions.
The situation must be nearly identical and no performance table EXPs should be granted for repeated procedures.
This can be done with research teams.

*Skills*:  Mechanics, like all other classes, have gained their knowledge from an array of inconsistent sources:  plain curious observation, books like "`101 Fission Projects for Kids`", or typewriter manuals.
The skills are probably more accurately referred to as pursuits -- old hobbies that the mechanic still has an interest in and likes to tinker around with.

The player is entitled to one roll on the Mechanic Skill table for every three points of INT.
For example, a persona with a 16 INT would get five rolls on the Mechanic Skill table.
If the player rolls the same skill more than once, she gains added proficiency by advancing levels in that area.
For example, if a player rolls engines twice, she has level two skills in engines.
This could be recorded as Engines 2 and whenever she works with engines, she will earn a DD bonus of -4.
The mechanic also gets a new random skill for every new experience level, the better chance the player has for success on the Mechanic Performance Table.
For more information about PT rolls, see Chapter 14: Performance Tables.

*Experience*:  Successful rolls on the performance table will earn the mechanic experience points.
How much experience depends on the DD of the accomplished task.
The mechanic will earn 80 EXPs per DD.
Mechanics can also gain a portion of combat experience.
They receive 20% of allotted combat experience.
As mechanics accumulate experience points, they may advance levels.
Higher experience levels aid the player on the performance tables and in combat.
