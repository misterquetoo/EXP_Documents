Mental strength represents the persona’s will power, luck and level of control over the mind’s unknown abilities.
The MSTR attribute is a mystical combination of ability and fantasy.
A persona with a high MSTR could endure torture longer than a persona with a low mental strength.
Varying abilities to withstand pain are well documented.
However, mental strength also reflects a persona’s psionic ability; something entirely undocumented to this date.

Mental strength has a direct contribution to the effectiveness of most mental mutations.
MSTR can affect the range, intensity and duration of psionic abilities.
The persona’s MSTR is the only natural defence the persona has against psionic attacks.
See Chapter 16.
Special Rolls for more information.

Attribute rolls may challenge MSTR when the persona is being tortured, maintaining a vow of silence, playing dice games or just plain hoping her luck will change.

Mental strength is generated on 4d4.
This produces a range of 4 to 16.
It is very important that MSTR retain this range because a person’s MSTR score is greatly adjusted by her INT – remember that a persona’s INT attribute can help focus her MSTR.
The effects of INT on MSTR are also discussed under Intelligence in this chapter.

Mental Strength shows the adjustment made to the person’s mental strength for differing levels of INT.
E.g. a persona with a 7 INT would lose 1 point of mental strength whereas a persona with a 16 INT would gain 2 points of mental strength.

If a persona’s MSTR should drop below 1, she is irrevocably deceased.
This type of death is caused by an evaporation of the life force of the brain.
The more observant of the readers may note that there is the potential for a persona to die while being created.
If the referee encounters such a low intelligence, low mental strength persona combination and it kills the persona during creation, the player should re-roll her persona’s attributes and start again.

There is no set upper limit to the MSTR of a persona; however, a referee should start to worry considerably about any MSTR that exceeds 20 points in value.
