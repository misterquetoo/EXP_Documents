[.s1]#Technology is diverse and prolific, and not all #[.s2]#technological devices can be immediately identified by personas.
Consider what sort of a potpourri of #[.s3]#technological devices would exist if they were drawn #[.s4]#from an entire universe of varying cultures, races and technological #[.s5]#levels.
No persona could expect to figure out the #[.s4]#mechanism of anything by merely the referee&#8217;s #[.s5]#description.
This is why a structured system for #identifying artifacts had to be devised.

[.s6]#These systems must be used by the #[.s7]#discretion of the referee.
The #[.s8]#Artifact #[.s9]#Identification #[.s10]#systems should not be used so #[.s2]#strictly that players cannot identify how to use a spatula (very #[.s11]#boring for the players), nor should the artifact identification#[.s12]# #[.s5]#system be used by players to &#8220;roll&#8221;
themselves #through a scenario.
The referee may decline AID [.s2]#rolls to players for any device which is important to #[.s1]#her scenario.
Obviously, if an entire scenario #revolves around some mysterious object, there is not much point in letting a player roll herself a [.s5]#solution to the scenario.
If a player should happen to identify an artifact herself (as opposed to her #[.s13]#persona) this is tough luck for the referee.
#[.s4]#Remember that this is a role-playing game, and #not a dice-rolling game.

== [.s14]#Theatrical AID System# {.p3}

[.s2]#A simple system for AID is based on attribute rolls.
The player must make an hard attribute roll under her INT to successfully identify the artifact.
The more #difficult to identify the artifact the more difficult [.s4]#the INT roll required.
This system offers little #[.s5]#flexibility for including factors like: Tech Level, procedure, or experience level.#

== [.s14]#Tactical AID Table System# {.p5}

[.s14]#A better system for artifact identification is the #[.s15]#AID Table.
#[.s2]#The #[.s15]#AID Table is+++<i>++++++</i>+++#[.s2]#a flowchart (Table 20.1) that allows the player to chart her persona&#8217;s #[.s4]#course through an artifact&#8217;s identification.
The #[.s16]#AID Table #[.s5]#includes factors such as how much time #[.s2]#is spent on the artifact, skill level of the identifier, #class of the identifier, Tech Level of device, and [.s5]#care of procedure.
#

[.s5]#The table #[.s5]#has key points indicating #[.s16]#identification, activation #[.s5]#and #[.s11]#damage.
Movement around the flowchart is #[.s10]#decided by modified d10 rolls.
Each d10 roll #[.s4]#indicates 1-10 minutes of investigation.
#Each circle on the flowchart has three [.s17]#exit #arrows, and one entrance arrow.
Which of the 3 [.s2]#exit arrows is taken by the player is determined by her die roll.
For example, a player located at circle #[.s3]#&#8220;B&#8221;
would return to circle &#8220;A&#8221;
if she rolled 4 or less;
#[.s2]#she would advance to circle &#8220;C&#8221;
if she rolled between 5 and 11, and if she were to roll 12, or better, the #artifact would be identified.
[.s3]#Each flowchart circle could be used to indicate a particular#[.s5]# strange sounds or flashing light on the #[.s4]#artifact.
Using this table allows the players, and #[.s5]#the ref, to get some idea of where they are in the #identification process.

== [.s14]#Starting the AID Table# {.p7}

[.s2]#The start is obviously where the player begins the identification process.
This is when the persona is #[.s4]#starting cold.
She is picking up an item that she #[.s2]#has never attempted to identify before.
If a persona #[.s3]#has stopped identifying an artifact, she must return #[.s5]#within a #[.s16]#+++<i>+++day +++</i>+++#[.s5]#if she wishes to restart where she left #[.s2]#off.
Another persona may continue where the old identifier left off only if the new persona had been paying attention for the whole of the identification #process.+++<figure id="attachment_9645" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9645" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[.size-medium.wp-image-9645] image::https://i0.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bot_tv_hand_win-300x300.png?resize=300%2C300[studiostoks.

== Identified

This means that the person has figured out what the artifact is and how it works.
Identification does not indicate that she knows everything about the artifact.
Identification should protect the persona from immediate harm.
For example a nuclear device would no longer be thought of as portable oven.
This does not mean the persona is skilled at using the artifact, knows it&#8217;s value, or knows its tech level.+++<figure id="attachment_9647" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9647" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[.size-medium.wp-image-9647] image::https://i0.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bot_tv_hand_activated-300x300.png?resize=300%2C300[studiostoks.

== [.s14]#Accidental Activation# {.p3}

[.s14]#Accidental activation indicates that the identifier #[.s18]#has unwittingly turned on the artifact.
For weapons, #[.s3]#bombs and grenades, the effects can be deadly.
For #[.s5]#devices that have been activated, and are wasting #[.s1]#precious batteries, a successful normal INT roll will #immediately deactivate the artifact.
When an [.s18]#artifact has been accidentally activated, it releases #[.s3]#considerable information about its use.
Therefore, #[.s2]#the player will return to the start with a #[.s23]#+++<i>++++2 +++</i>+++bonus #[.s24]#on all successive rolls.
#[.s18]#The bonuses for accidental #activation are cumulative.
If the identifier [.s2]#accidentally activates the artifact again, she will #[.s5]#return to the start with #[.s25]#+4.
If this is some kind of weapon and it discharges the expedition will likely automatically identify the artifact along with the damage it delivers.

== [.s14]#Artifact Damage# {.p5}

[.s3]#This flowchart point indicates that the device has #[.s5]#been damaged.
Arrival at this destination could #[.s2]#be announced by horrible crunching noises, or sickening #[.s26]#sprats.
#[.s2]#After this occurs, the identifier returns to the start.
High-tech artifacts should not #instantly be damaged by the fumblings of the [.s3]#identifier.
Any artifact that the ref feels#[.s27]#_ _#[.s3]#cannot be damaged by the identifier, should not be damaged.
#[.s2]#If an identifying player continually lands on the #[.s14]#point indicating damage, then Table 20.2: Extent of Equipment Damage #[.s3]#may be warranted.
The extent of damage has an effect on the repair of damaged #[.s2]#equipment.
#.

== Artifact Identification {.p13}

[.s14]#Identification of an artifact can mean many things.
#[.s5]#Usually identification only indicates the general #use of the artifact type.
For example, this is a [.s3]#medical device for healing (not a bomb), this is a drug (not perfume), this is #[.s2]#a napalm aerosol (not hair spray).
Complete identification depends on the persona&#8217;s class.
[.s18]#For example, Mercenaries can identify bombs, attack aerosols, and weapons succinctly.
Some artifacts have specific class designations.
##[.s2]#Items such as climbing equipment may be #[.s3]#classed as nomad.
Cooking utensils may be classed #[.s2]#as nothin.
All classes can identify vehicles.
No class restriction apply if a player identifies an artifact by role-playing!!#

== AID Flowchart Adjustments {.p13}

[.s2]#There are many factors that affect the persona&#8217;s navigation through Artifact Identification#[.s18]#: INT of the identifier, Tech Level of the toy, class of the identifier, and skill level of the identifier.
#[.s1]#These adjustments are another point where #[.s2]#mechanics, and all other classes, diverge.
When #[.s3]#using the flowchart, mechanics roll a d10, but all #[.s2]#other classes roll a d8.
All classes are subject to #[.s5]#adjustments on the INT Table, the Tech Level #[.s2]#Table, and the procedure table.
However, only mechanics can use a skill bonus.#

[.s32]#*Intelligence*: In regards to identifying artifacts #[.s18]#smart personas #[.s30]#do better, and dumb personas do worse.
Table 20.2 Intelligence  AID Adjustments#[.s30]#.
A persona with an 8 INT would #[.s14]#subtract 1 from each d8 roll.
However, a mechanic #[.s2]#with a 16 INT would add 3 to every d10 roll.
It #should be easy to see who&#8217;s going to be more [.s2]#successful at identifying equipment.#

[.s34]#[table id=206 /]#

[.s34]#*Tech Level*: #[.s2]# Tech level is a term #that loosely represents the artifact&#8217;s level of [.s4]#technological development.
EXP&#8217;s tech level #[.s2]#system is defined in some detail in http://expgame.com/?page_id=359[Chapter 56: ]#[.s18]#http://expgame.com/?page_id=359[Tech Level].
#[.s30]# A person from the Middle Ages would almost #[.s14]#certainly be at a loss in a modern kitchen, and it is #[.s5]#unlikely that someone from today&#8217;s high-tech #[.s2]#kitchen could prepare a meal with utensils from #[.s5]#the Middle Ages.
The problem of Tech Level, #[.s2]#however, goes beyond this.#

[.s3]#All personas are assumed to originate from #Tech Level 10 societies.
Tech Levels 6-12 are [.s18]#similar enough not to present any serious difficulty #[.s3]#to the identifier.
For example, a person from our #[.s30]#own technical society (Terran, western, 1980) would #[.s5]#have a good idea of how to operate most 19th century artifacts, and will likely to be able to function up to about 50 years into the future.
#[.s2]#Beyond this TL 6-12 range, there are probably enough unfamiliarities to confuse a persona--#[.s3]#hence, penalties are added, at the rate of minus 1 #[.s2]#per Tech Level above 12, and below 6.
#

[.s37]#[table id=207 /]#

*Identification Style*: A[.s2]#djustments are added  depending on how the persona conducts her study of the artifact.
For example, if the player #[.s3]#says that her persona is being very careful she will #[.s30]#add 3 to her 1d10 roll whenever on circle E (accidental #[.s18]#activation possible), or on circle F (artifact damage #[.s2]#possible).
However being careful extends the time taken for identification.
Rushing along can speed up the time to identification, or accidental activation.
