Homo Insectum is the pseudo-scientific term for the family of insectoid.
An insectoid will sport the head shape of whatever insect type is chosen.
Insectoids also have an exoskeleton-like skin covering and decorative limbs and/or wings.
An insectoid persona could resemble a bee, wasp, worm, slug, flea, mosquito, beetle, tick, louse, moth, grasshopper, dragonfly, etc.
Since there is such variety in the insect world, it must be re-emphasized here that the descriptive character of the persona is nothing more than that.
The insectoid is a bipedal, upright humanoid that possesses no abilities other than those described here and whatever additional mutations are rolled.
For example, a persona modelled after a wolf spider could not make a web nor could a bee-like homo insectum sting; however, special mutations may yield such abilities.

They receive a bonus of +1 for every 5 points of MSTR on saves versus psionic attack.
