Bombs are a subsection of grenades and aerosols (chapter 45).
Bombs are nothing more than great big grenades.
They have a greater area of effect, inflict more damage, and have longer durations than the grenades, or aerosols, that they are modelled after.

Bombs are very deadly--misuse of a fusion bomb would certainly melt an entire expedition in the flash of a hydrogen atom.
Even previously safe aerosols can become dangerous when amplified to the proportions of a bomb&8211;a foam bomb could easily entomb an entire unsuspecting expedition.

There is not a detailed explanation of every deadly bomb.
Table 44.3: Bomb Type indicates what grenade, or aerosol, type is to be increased to the proportions of which bomb.
Many grenades, and aerosols, have special effects which are also increased when they are fashioned into bombs, Clouds , fires, radioactivity, or ice fields will last 10 times longer than the durations listed for aerosols, and grenades.
The intensities of poisons are generated in the same manner as the grenade, or aerosol, type.
The intensity of a bomb attack cannot exceed 25, unless the base weapon type already can.

== Range 

This aerosol statistic does not apply to bombs, even if the bomb is modelled after an aerosol.
When a bomb is detonated, it destroys itself, and its area of effect reaches out around it.
It also should be obvious that bombs cannot be thrown any great distance.

== Area of Effect 

The area of effect operates similarly to the area of effect of grenades, and aerosols.
The only difference is that a bomb's area of effect radius is 20 times greater than its base type.
All incidental area of effect radii are also multiplied by 20.
E.g., the fusion bomb has an area of effect that inflicts damage, one that blinds, one that immolates, and one that irradiates.
The radius of each of these effects is multiplied by 20.
Those bombs modelled after weapons that have a swath attack, will also have a swath attack as a bomb.
The dimensions of the swath attack are increased 20 times.

The cover granted to a bomb attack must be much more substantial than that needed to impede a grenade.
For instance cover from a grenade attack could be offered by the wall of a house, or the corner of a building.
In the case of a bomb, only a military bunker may be able to protect the target.
Bombs are deadly.
They are designed to destroy large areas effectively and economically.

== Damage 

Any damage that the base weapon inflicts is multiplied by 10.
This is the factor that makes bombs so incredibly deadly, because even the most trivial damage amounts are multiplied to killer proportions.
If the referee feels that a non-lethal base grenade, or aerosol, has been made too deadly by the change in damage, she may feel free to alter it.

== Wate 

A bomb will have a wate 25 times greater than its grenade, or aerosol counterpart.

== EXPS 

Bombs are worth the same number of EXPS of the grenade or aerosol that they are modelled after.

== Value 

The value of a bomb is 50 times that of its base aerosol, or grenade type.

== Detonators 

Unlike aerosols, bombs are completely self consuming.
When bombs are detonated, they destroy themselves, and attempt to spread their effects over the greatest possible area.

A bomb's detonator is truly the nitty gritty of the device.
Unlike grenades and aerosols, none of the bomb's detonators are designed with personal safety in mind.
The bombs have radio detonators, fuses, or some other form of long range triggering device which allows for user safety.
Once the detonator is activated the bomb will explode spreading death all about itself.
Fooling with a bomb's detonator could very easily annihilate and entire expedition.
There is a 75% chance that a bomb's detonator will be detached from the bomb itself.

== Description 

Bombs have shapes and colours the same as grenades do.
Even if the bomb has an aerosol effect, it will have one of the bomb shapes generated in this section.
Use Table 44.1: Bomb Shape, and Table 44.2: Bomb Colour to determine a random description of the bomb.

// insert table 435

// insert table 436

// insert table 437

== Bomb Type 

include::ROOT:partial$CH44_Table_Bomb_Type.adoc[]

== 1) Grand Slam 

// insert table 439

This is the ultimate concussion grenade knocking down and stunning everything in its area of effect.

== 2) Corrosive Bomb 

// insert table 440

Initial damage is rolled on 50d8.
Eats away at inorganic materials for 10 to 80 units, inflicting 20 to 200 (20d10) hit points of damage each unit.

== 3) Polar Bomb 

// insert table 441

There is a 1% chance per hit point of damage inflicted of the target being trapped in ice.

== 4) Black Out Bomb 

// insert table 442

The black out bomb will drain all batteries within 200 hexes and explode for a killing attack within 60 hexes.
The damage of the killing attack depends on the amount of energy around to drain.
If there is a power plant near by, the bomb will be ferocious, but if there are not many batteries near by the bomb will only be lethal.
50d4 would be a good amount of damage for a populated technological area.
If this bomb were discharged near a nuclear power plant the Black out bomb may function like a http://expgame.com/?page_id=3357-nuclear-device[Nuclear Device].
A black out bomb would turn off robots, unless they are Combat Robots (type C) and hardened against such attacks.

== 5) Lazer Bomb 

// insert table 443

Sends a lazer sheet parallel to the ground, travelling with the contours of the terrain, damaging all targets along the way.
This bomb is also called a trench clearer.

Bringing peace and liberty to innocent civilians everywhere.+++<figure id="attachment_9637" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9637" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[.size-medium.wp-image-9637] image::https://i0.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bomb_short_fuse-300x300.png?resize=300%2C300[studiostoks stock illustration modified HM,300]+++<figcaption id="caption-attachment-9637" class="wp-caption-text">+++Bad fuse choice for a nuclear device.+++</figcaption>++++++</figure>+++

== 7) Nuclear Device 

// insert table 445

Anything that is tiny, small, or medium sized within the area of effect, will explode without any saving throw.
Any flammable object within 300 hexes will instantly immolate.
Any organic creatures within 400 hexes will be blinded for 1 to 8 hours.
Any target within 600 hexes (that is 1.2 kilometers) will be irradiated for an intensity equal to 1/10 the blast damage.
These effects are cumulative as the target gets closer to the epicenter.

== 8) Nerve Bomb 

// insert table 446

Refer to Table 44.4, +++<i>+++Gas Type +++</i>+++to determine the effect of the gas.
The gas will attack as a poison with an intensity of 4 to 24.
Note that nerve gas need not be inhaled to have its effect.
Simply touching the contaminated area may produce the effect.
The area will remain poisoned for 1 day per intensity of poison attack.
For more information refer to chapter 45.

// insert table 447

== 9) Grav Bomb 

// insert table 448

The bomb affects anything up to 100 tonnes in wate.
The bomb will either lift the targets up into the air, to fall 1 to 10 hexes afterward, or smash the targets into the ground with 1 to 10 gravities.
Either instantaneous acceleration (up or down) will inflict 1-12 hit points in damage per gravity of acceleration.
If used in zog (zero gravity) the targets will fly away at 1 h/u per 2 hit points of damage.
This affects everything less than 100 tonnes in wate.

== 10) Junk Yard 

// insert table 449

The bomb cannot be moved from its location, and it will attract anything less than 5 tonnes towards its epicenter.
The attractor will usually have a penchant for a certain material type of the referee's discretion.
This could be dirt, skin, or air car hulls.

== 11) Disintegrator 

// insert table 450

Please consult the grenade directly for the details of this peculiar, and unpredictable weapon.
Anything disintegrated is turned into warm gas, and anything damaged is missing little slivers of itself.
Simply put everything within the blast radius is destroyed.
No saving throw.
Every thing in the effect radius will take 8d8 hit points of damage.
There is absolutely no cover offered.

// insert table 451

== 12) Jumping Jack 

// insert table 452

The jumping jack bomb will have several explosions with unpredictable effect.
Roll once on Table 44.6, to determine its method of effect.
There will be a 1 to 30 unit pause per explosion, and the new epicenter will be 20 to 120 hexes away from the last one.
The next explosion will be in a random direction from the last one.
Refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=304miss-result[Result of Grenade Miss] to  help determine where the next epicenter will be.


// insert table 453

== 13) Immolator

// insert table 454

When discharged the bomb launches itself into the air, and sprays napalm along its path.
Additional burning damage will usually be irrelevant to all but the freshest combat robot.
The path will burn for 20 to 80 units after the attack, inflicting 20 to 240  (20d12) HPS in burning damage each unit.

== 14) Diversion Bomb 

// insert table 455

This bomb will either be flash, smoke, or sonic.
The flash bomb will blind all those within the area of effect for 1 to 10 hours.
A smoke bomb will obscure the area of effect for 1 to 10 hours.
A sonic bomb will deafen all targets for 1 to 10 hours.
The targets get a chance to save versus mental attack for blinding and deafening.
The intensity of the attack is 8 to 24 (8d3).
For more information about saves refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=275saving-throw[Saving Throws].

== 15) Neutron Bomb 

// insert table 456

This hater of all things organic does not damage structures or robots.
A neutron bomb bathes everything in the area of effect with destructive radiation.
Only those organics hardened to radiation can avoid the initial wave of damage.
Anything that survives the initial attack them must win a save versus intensity 25 radiation.For more information about saves refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=275saving-throw[Saving Throws].
The area will remain &8220;hot&8221;
for 1 month per point of damage inflicted, likely for many years.
What mad alien race invented such a sick and twisted device?

== 16) Sky Breaker 

// insert table 457

This bomb combines a massive serving of destruction with it's shock and awe.
The exploding bomb explodes straight up apparently having absolutely no effect on the surrounding area.
Then 20 to 60 units later the area of effect is annihilated with shards of iridescent glowing ice raining from the sky.
This bomb does work exatmo.

== 17) Torc Bomb 

// insert table 458

The torc bomb (aka Forced Field Bomb) does no damage to anything not contained within a force field.
The bomb makes all force fields implode on themselves for 120 to 1440 (12d12 times 10) hit points in damage.
The bomb cannot implode a force field which is greater than 240 hexes in diameter.

== 18) Lazer Cover 

// insert table 459

For 1 to 10 hours lazers will have no effect.
The cover does not obscure vision, or energy weapons, but harmlessly dissipates all lazers.
This bomb is also called the peacemaker.


== 19) Dismodulator 


// insert table 460

Everything that is inorganic within a 20 hex radius of effect will be converted into a cloud of freezing, iridescent gas.
A saving throw versus intensity 13 to 28 (3d6 plus 10) is granted to persona robots.
All organic creatures within a 60 hex radius will take 50 to 600 (50d6) HPS in damage from the frozen careening dismodulation byproducts.
For more information about saves refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=275saving-throw[Saving Throws].

== 20) EMP Bomb 

// insert table 461

The Electromagnetic pulse bomb incapacitates all non-hardened electronic devices within the area of effect.
Military hardware will get a save versus poison intensity 4 to 24.
Non-military hardware will cease to function for 15 hours, with a 15% chance of suffering permanent equipment damage.
See http://expgame.com/?page_id=286[Chapter 21: Equipment Damage].
For more information about saves refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=275saving-throw[Saving Throws].

== 21) Foam Bomb 

// insert table 462

The foam bomb instantly covers its area of effect with a rapidly hardening blob of all encompassing foam.
The foam bomb will entrap any target that remains in the area of effect for more that 20 units.
Suffocation is not a risk.
The foam pad is permanent, does not decompose for trapped personas starvation is a real possibility.

== 22) Tracker Bomb 

// insert table 463

All matter will be coated with chemicals that emit heat, vibrations, aromas, light and radiation.
The effect is immediate exposing all hidden objects within the area of effect.
This will expose potential ambush, invisible or camouflaged targets within the area of effect.

== 23) Cover Bomb 

// insert table 464

Every sense is dulled to uselessness within this dense cloud.
Targets are blind, deaf, unable to smell, and must crawl in a  random direction to hopefully escape the area of effect.
Getting lost within a cover bomb area of effect  for the entire 10 to 60 day duration is a real possibility.

== 24) Diffusion Bomb 

// insert table 465

The massive amount of damage is delivered to everything in the area of effect in a manner that is left to the improvisational talents of the referee.

== 25) Paint Bomb 

// insert table 466

The paint bomb covers everything within range with paint the same colour as the bomb's casing.
Yes, it can paint everything striped within an 80 hex radius.
Those personas that don't win a DEX attribute* *roll will be blinded for 1 to 20 minutes.
The paint will also make an intensity 1-6 poison attack on all organics covered in paint.
Attribute rolls and saving throws are covered in http://expgame.com/?page_id=275[Chapter 16: Special Rolls].


// insert table 436

== 26) Toxin Bomb 

// insert table 467

Use Table 44.8: Cides to determine what target type is exterminated by the toxin bomb.
Targets must save versus intensity 2 to 24 poison, or die.
Those that win the save versus death will take poison damage.
This is a very deadly weapon.
There is no lasting effect on the terrain.
For more information about saves refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=275saving-throw[Saving Throws].

// insert table 468

== 27) Bug Bomb 

// insert table 469 + The repelled type of creature will make every effort to escape from the area of effect of the repellent.
Personas must win a save versus intensity 13 to 28 (3d6 plus 10) toxin or have to leave the area of effect.
For more information about saves refer to http://expgame.com/?page_id=275saving-throw[Saving Throws].

// insert table 468

== 28) Sound Bomb

// insert table 470

The ear splitting siren will wail for 2 to 8 minutes.
This attack will deafen all targets for 1 to 10 days.
This has severe ecological effects on the environment, since all small animals tend to die of fright.

== 29)  Cloud Maker 

// insert table 471

The cloud maker create a gigantic immobile cloud of a particular colour.
The cloud will disperse over 10 to 80 (1d8 times 10) weeks, or it can be removed by excavation equipment.
The colour of the smoke will match the colour of the casing of the bomb.
The cloud will function like opaque smoke described under http://expgame.com/?page_id=314meteorological-conditions[Meteorological Conditions].
The colour of smoke is determined on the Color Bomb table below.


// insert table 436

== 30) Sticky Bomb 

// insert table 472

The area of effect is covered with a spider web like glue that entraps everything.
The targets are trapped for at least 20 to 160 (2d8 times 10) minutes until the web decomposes.
A http://expgame.com/?page_id=275attribute-rolls[bizarre PSTR roll] may free the target.
There is a 3% chance of gluing one's mouth shut, and suffocating.
