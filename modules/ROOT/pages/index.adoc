== What is this? 

EXP: The Game of Technological Chaos is a paper and dice science fantasy role playing game. 
It is *not* a POV shooter video game, movie, or app. 
You play EXP with dice and real people all sitting in the same room. 
Enjoy.

== Why is this?

EXP: The Game of Technological Chaos evolved from role playing games in the late 1970s.
Dungeons and Dragons, Gamma World and most importantly Metamorphosis Alpha.
James Ward is our hero.

== Testing This

=== Sectums
This version is testing sectnums.
Sectnums activated in playbook does not work as expected. 
Hopefully I do not need to adjust the = and == section headers.


=== Attributes
Testing a global variable (called attribute here) called test variable. 

test-variable = {test-variable}

Testing antora attributes.
Retrying with triple brackets.

First test is for bread crumbs {{{page.breadcrumbs}}}

Another test for module info {{{page.module}}}

=== Admonitions
Testing admonition fonts setting.
Clearly I am missing something on admonitions. 
I have removed the icons thing for admonitions. 


TIP: Admonitions should not be hard. 

CAUTION: Did your admonition work?
