Datalyzers used to be called analog monitors.
Datalyzers are tin-can thinkers stuffed with artificial intelligence. 
At the core of the AI is a semi-organic, electronically enhanced central computing unit.
They are so stuffed with complex AI that they tend to be emotional and can have mental mutations.
