Each event is a 2d6 roll with bonuses based on vs checks
. higher level gets plus one
. higher AR gets plus one

Personas can use 1 versus per 2 levels

So a level 10 persona would get 5 versus and a level 4 persona would only get two



level up is 12 on 2d6 after each run.
ref may grant extra rolls for stellar acts
