= Random Junque

The title of this chapter is self explanatory.
The tables contained in here are filled with lists of completely useless equipment.
It is almost certain that these artifacts have existed in every society in one form or another.
Random junque is useless equipment when compared to the artifacts created by TOYs
However players regularly find use for random junque during their sessions. 

Random junque should not count as a roll for players generating start up Toys.

EXPS::
Players should earn decent EXPS if they manage to use random junque in their game session.
The EXPS earned usually ends in 42, and ranges from 42 to 1042 experience points.

Value::
Random junque has a random resale value of 1-10 (1d10) eps.
There is also a 10% chance that sacrificing a piece of random junque will generate a spare part.
A spare part can be used to fix a more objectively useful artifact.

== 16) Ref's Own Table 

The ref's own table for random junque should consist of those useless things that are found in the culture that she is creating.
It may be a bit cynical, but this system is created with the belief that their will always be waste, incompetence and corruption available to waste corporate, and government dollars on useless items.
Another thing to consider is whether or not it is worth having a refs own table for random junque.
There are lots of things to prepare for the referee already, and unless random junque is really offering something humorous to the milieu then may she should go do something else.
