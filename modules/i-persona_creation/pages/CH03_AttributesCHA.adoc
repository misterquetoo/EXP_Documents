Charisma is charm, looks and sociability all combined into one value.
A high charisma represents a high proficiency at getting along with other personas.
This attribute is a universal so any persona with a high CHA would be socially adept.
A personaâ€™s charisma is very important for inter-persona interactions.

Charisma can shift the results of promotions, wooing, sales, leading, and negotiations.
CHA should influence role-playing, and not replace it.
A persona with a high CHA should not avoid opportunities to role-play.
CHA need not influence the behaviour of the persona. 
A persona with a negative CHA may be kind and considerate.

Charisma for organic creatures is quite similar.
An alien with high charisma may make comforting noises or have an attractive hide.
Robotic charisma can be exuded with it's personality or elegant chrome stylings.

The range of CHA is typically 3 to 18. 
However, burns, scars, mutations, limps, etc. may reduce a persona's CHA.
CHA below 1 is highly irregular but not impossible.
Organic personas do not die if their CHA becomes negative.
However the reaction of referee personas to the low CHA may be fatal.
