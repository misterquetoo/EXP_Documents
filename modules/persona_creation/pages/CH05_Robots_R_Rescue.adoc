=== R) Rescue

There are two types of emergency bots: rescue (used for removing people from inhospitable and unhealthy situations) and spillage (used for containing contaminants).
To qualify as a rescue emergency bot, the personas DEX must be 22 or higher.

==== Retrieval

// table insert 47

Retrieval bots are used to remove people or bodies from dangerous situations such as fires, landslides, radioactive areas, outer-space, etc.
They are capable of performing their duties underwater, in zero-gravity or in a vacuum.
These bots can also save people against their will, stashing them into a nice cool stasis chamber  
for their own good, of course.
The robot will have one stasis chamber for every two points of PSTR.
People stored in the chambers cannot be killed or in any way come to harm unless the bot is destroyed.
All rescue bots roll their size on the outdoor table.
Rescue bots also have loudspeakers and sirens for warning signals and 150 hexes of glowing retractable fencing for cordoning off danger areas.

==== Spillage

// table insert 48

Spillage bots are not sloppy drink servers  
they are bots designed to control the spillage of deadly chemicals or to contain fires.
Spillage bots can sense deadly chemicals at a range of ten hexes per point of AWE but only if there is a lethal amount of the poison present.
Once the bot detects a nasty substance, it can be safely stored away inside the bot by an array of shovels, rakes and scoops.
The chance of doing this successfully is equal to five times the personas DEX.

Once collected, the garbage will be stored in a cargo hold with a capacity of 20 times the personas WA.
The spillage bot is capable of sifting through debris and storing only the toxic materials.
Eventually, the spillage bot will run out of storage space.

At this point, a spillage bot can cover the toxic area with a sealing plastic.
The bot will normally have enough spray-on plastic to cover 100 hexes.
This spray-on plastic can also function as a webgun (see Chapter 46: Guns).
Poisonous junk cannot be completely forgotten once stashed away;
a full spillage bot may begin to glow, radiate or attract strange animals.

The spillage bot also has flame retardant which will extinguish all normal fires.
The bot can extinguish 5 hexes of fire for every point of CON.
For example, a bot with CON 22 could put out 110 flaming hexes.
The player can regulate how much retardant is used each time and need not expend the whole lot at one go.
Spillage bots can fence off 250 hexes of danger zone with their glowing retractable fencing.
They have a base AR of 875 and roll their size on the outdoor table.+++<figure id="attachment_720" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-720" style="width: 209px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i0.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/policingbot.61-209x300.png?resize=209%2C300[Social bot right.
