= Robot Value
The value of the bot is its base worth relative to all the robot types described.
The values indicated are for the basic unit that rolls off the assembly line.
The strange peripherals that may have just happened, or are added to the basic robot type, increase the robot's value.
Primary peripherals are worth about 10000 to 60000 each and secondary peripherals about 100000 to 600000 each.
The adjustment of the robot's base value is really up to the referee.
Any artifacts that are attached to the robot are tripled in value and added to the robot's value.
Robots that are worth incredible sums of money or have particularly valuable peripherals will often find themselves being greedily pursued by former owners or prospective "`buyers`".
