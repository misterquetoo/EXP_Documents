Constitution represents a persona’s internal physique.
The main components of CON are the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys and immune system.
A high CON is better to repel disease, resist poisons, and repair damaged tissue.

The constitution represents internal hardiness it points.
The relationship between CON and HPS is detail and directly influences structural integrity as well.
The CON is used to determine the persona's HPS.

The CON attribute is rolled on 3d6.  If a persona’s CON should drop below 1, she is irrevocably dead due to combined heart, liver, kidney and immune system failure.
