= Robot Movement Rate
Robotic movement rate is determined by the robot's DEX attribute.

Robots are twice as fast as those personas with the same DEX.
Those bots which move faster than 8 hu, must accelerate the same as vehicles.
Robotic acceleration is one hex per unit per PSTR level (I-IV).

A robot that has a 17 DEX and PSTR level of 3 would move 8 hu at first, 11 hu the next unit and then reach maximum speed of 14 hu in the next unit.
These cumbersome acceleration rules should only be applied in rare instances when the players have decided that picayune detail is of upmost importance.
Depending on the locomotion type, bots are affected by terrain just as regular personas are.
