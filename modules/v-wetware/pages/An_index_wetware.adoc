= Wetware
Wetware refers to the biomagical wet and mushy elements crucial to sciency fiction.
Wetware has suffered many different titles over the decades: biologics, bioware, and plain old mutations. 
In EXP's generic mythos wetware covers artificial intelligence, mental mutations and physical mutations. 
In the mythos of EXP all three of these are mushy and have a primary biologic process at their core. 
If this mythos does not concur with your milieu change it at your leisure.
