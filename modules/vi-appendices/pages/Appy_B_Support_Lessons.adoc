= Appendix B3: Roadmap

NOTE: *More of garbage collection than a roadmap.*

== ERRATA
Too many to even list here.


== ROADMAP

== Version 6.0 (this version)
Mission and vision.
Accessibility.
Safe and Supportive.
Pulled trigger on HPS splitting into HPM an HPT. 
requires a massive find and replace. 
SS is now SOC.

Apophenia:: “the tendency to perceive a connection or meaningful pattern between unrelated or random things (such as objects or ideas)”  Greek apo- (away, off, apart) + phainein (to show).

.*Generic Mythos*
* time and chronovores hideaways, teleport, time stop and holdaways.
* sciency fiction vs science fiction vs science fantasy
* mutations mental, physical, evolution vs random, psionic vs physical space
* The power of mutations should be delicately balanced with subtle inconveniences.
* Roll vs Role
* Consciousness
** Organics transfer sentience via reproduction and evolution
** Robots get sentience by accident unique and isolated
** AI (artificial or autonomous) are fabricated with consciousness

.*Pithy Aphorisms*
* all are players
** referee is a player
** communication skills are paramount
** LACE for communications
* one roll to rule them all and in the story bind them (4D2)
** one die one roll one sub story
* post factualization
* technomagical
* macro, micro, nano, molecular, ethereal bonds
* Story before dice, and story before rules
* Choose story and fun over rules and rolls.
* Find the least number of rules necessary and use one less
* the EXPedition EXPlores for EXPeriences.
* EXP is the game of technological chaos, and the dice deliver the chaos.

====
Personal body armour is a perverse form of self-defense.
It is designed to protect someone who cannot, or will not, avoid combat situations.
It is as much an instrument of violence as any weapon.
The best way to avoid taking damage from combat is to avoid combat, 
====


====
The EXP system is based on complete technological chaos.
Eons and eons of diverging levels of technology are layered on top of, and beside, each other.
Any of which may or may not be alien.

====
Go to sleep meat bag. This is frustrating. Robots do not express frustration.

.*Story Telling Methods*
* campaign is a Story Arch in a Milieu
** Story Arch is built from sub-stories
*** sub stories built from combat stories, and procedure stories
**** combat stories are told by dice and players
**** procedure stories are told by dice and players
** Story Arch is tied together by threads
*** threads are persona stories
**** player personas and referee personas

.*Story Telling is improv*
* a technical manual for creating sciency fiction stories through improv rpg
* sub-stories are the building block
** sub stories use STEPS and dice
* listening to players is LACE
* persona stories are Three Parts and STEPS

//baked in for robots
//high roll FTW
//tool vs tech vs comp vs AI
//vocation
//Roll vs Role
//Tale of two systems
//Skills (knowledge base) procedure (actual act)
//rules written from the point of challenging players (crazy limitations and examples) 

// needs a milieu section


// these rules are common language for a shared imagination experience.

// is armour a fixed AR or an AR adjustment 

== Movie List

.. Mercenaries fight aliens and an android. (Aliens)
.. Mercenaries fight aliens. (Starship Troopers)
. alphabetical order
. Include the trailer.

== Images
Repair of malformed alt="" has been repaired for accessibility.

----
// this is for inserting art
// attributes are set in the referring adoc
// using inline image because it allows tooltip 
// centering by assigning imageblock css

  "insert IMAGE": {
    "prefix": "adoc ins IMAGE",
    "body": [
      ":art: $1",
      ":width: 250px",
      ":snark: $2",

articulate.adoc is the include
