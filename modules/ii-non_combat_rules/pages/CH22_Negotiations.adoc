[.s1]#Negotiation is the only game system which appears to be replacing role-playing.
#Negotiation should not be used to replace interactions between personas and referee personas[.s1]#.
The negotiation system should be used by the referee to assist making a decision for a referee persona #[.s2]#where one hasn&#8217;t already been predetermined.
#[.s1]#The referee cannot think like all beings at all #[.s3]#times, and negotiation rolls replace such thought processes.
The negotiation tables give results for #[.s4]#conversations between the expedition and #[.s5]#intelligent aliens, civilians, or mad robots.
#[.s1]#Negotiation rolls bring some essential randomness #[.s2]#into scenarios.
If refs are forced to #[.s3]#continually improvise, their own personality will #[.s1]#invade all the personas that they play, and their #[.s3]#actions will become predictable.
Negotiation does #[.s6]#not apply to detailed scenarios where reactions are #[.s7]#predetermined like: ambushes, pirate raids, #[.s8]#muggings, or starving aliens.#+++<figure id="attachment_1906" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1906" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">+++[image:https://i0.wp.com/expgame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/negotiation.271-210x300.png?resize=210%2C300[Like dude.

== [.s10]#Pre-Negotiations +
# {.p3}

[.s11]#An initial percentile roll (d100) can be made on the #[.s1]#negotiation table when the referee personas are #[.s11]#sizing up the expedition.
This +++<b>+++pre-greeting roll +++</b>+++#[.s6]#consists of judging the smell of the expedition, the #[.s1]#numbers of the expedition, and the body language of the expedition members.
This roll could set up #[.s4]#the mood of the greetings, and may affect #[.s2]#subsequent negotiation rolls.
The pre-greeting #[.s6]#decisions are made as the two expeditions approach #[.s1]#each other.
There may be actual air sniffing and #[.s9]#staring going on, but most of the preliminary #[.s3]#actions are entirely unconscious.
The pre-greeting #[.s4]#roll is determined almost entirely on first #impression.

[.s2]#Once conversation begins the referee may make another negotiation roll to determine how #[.s3]#the RPs will respond or act.
The result of the d100 roll may lead to a reaction that varies from openly #[.s2]#helpful, to lethally violent.
The higher the d100 #[.s8]#roll the better the negotiation result is for the #[.s2]#expedition.
The referee should moderate these #[.s1]#reactions with her common sense: no random die #[.s2]#roll system can accurately replace role-playing #[.s1]#parley, but it can help.
#Do not use the negotiation tables too literally.
[.s3]#The referee should adjust the reactions with what #[.s1]#little common sense she has left.#

== [.s3]#Social Negotiations# {.p11}

[.s9]#Not all failed negotiation results in violence.
#[.s6]#Obviously a merchant isn&#8217;t going to attack a persona that walks into her shop.
A shopkeeper&#8217;s tone may vary from openly helpful to belligerent, but combat #[.s3]#with a customer would be an impossibility.
When #[.s14]#combat should not be a possible outcome of negotiation, use Table 22.1, #[.s15]#+++<i>+++Administrative +++</i>+++#[.s16]#_Negotiation._#

[.s17]#Typical situations requiring a roll on the Social Negotiations#[.s18]#__ __T#[.s6]#able would be: dealing #[.s8]#with a receptionist;
getting a traffic ticket;
or #[.s3]#enquiring with a shopping store clerk.
The results #[.s4]#may have varying degrees of bureaucratic #[.s3]#annoyance, but no violence.
If the referee is trying #[.s6]#to pull a fast one on the expedition, and is attempting #[.s14]#to turn a seemingly harmless situation into a #[.s6]#violent one, a properly prepared scenario should be #used.

Let&#8217;s consider a persona who goes to buy a loaf [.s14]#of krenoj at the local krenojeri.
This is not a #potentially lethal encounter, so Table 22.1: Social Negotiations [.s14]#is used.
The cashier at the #[.s1]#krenojeri is a quiet, conservative avarian woman.
The persona buying the krenoj is a flamboyant, #[.s2]#exotically dressed feline fellow (11 CHA).
The #[.s3]#unadjusted pre-greeting roll is 42.
Looking directly on the table would indicate that the cashier is going #[.s8]#to treat the customer in a perfectly functional manner, however there are adjustments.
#[.s6]#The feline&#8217;s CHA is added to the roll, making it #[.s9]#53.
This is still functional.
The two personas #[.s6]#obviously have conflicting personalities, so a penalty #[.s3]#of -5 reduces the roll to 48.
In the pre-greeting roll #[.s1]#the primal instincts of the avarian take over, and #[.s2]#the anthro type penalty (avarians hate felines) of -20 #[.s1]#reduces the roll further, to 28.
The final result of #[.s2]#the pre-greeting roll is &#8216;bad vibes&#8217;.
The cashier #[.s3]#expresses this feeling by serving someone else, out #[.s1]#of queue, and ahead of the feline.#

[.s1]#When the feline speaks up, expecting to be served, the second  negotiation roll, the action roll #[.s6]#is made.
The ref rolls an 18 (ooh that&#8217;s bad) for her #[.s8]#avarian persona.
The total penalty of -14 still #[.s1]#applies, but an additional penalty of -15 for `bad vibes&#8217;
on last roll increases the penalties to a total #[.s3]#of-29.
The final adjusted negotiation roll is -11.
T#[.s4]#his #[.s3]#indicates &#8216;look out&#8217;
for trouble on the Social Negotiations Table.#

[.s6]#The worst possible course of action will usually #[.s3]#be taken by the RP at this time.
The avarian clerk then #[.s1]#plunks a sign under the nose of the feline stating &#8216;#gone for lunch&#8217;, and she strides to the back of the [.s1]#krenojeri.
This is infuriating, but not violent, and the same system can apply to traffic cops, holo-movie ushers, pets, salespeople, etc.#

== Combat Negotiation {.p2}

[.s20]#The #[.s21]#Combative #[.s22]#Negotiation T#[.s11]#able is used for encounters which #[.s8]#could result in combat.
Examples #[.s6]#would include when the expedition meets a herd of #[.s2]#intelligent animals in the wilderness;
when the #[.s14]#expedition collides with a group of drunken #[.s2]#revellers: or when the expedition comes across #[.s6]#another foraging expedition.
Any of these situations #could require the referee, or player designate, to roll a d100 against the [.s18]#Combative Negotiation T#[.s6]#able.
If the referee has an encounter properly prepared the negotiation tables #[.s23]#should not be used.
#

[.s2]#Two human expeditions come across each #[.s7]#other while looting an ancient ruin for high #[.s3]#technology.
The persona expedition was trying to #[.s4]#open a jammed door, and didn&#8217;t notice the #[.s1]#approaching expedition.
The referee expedition #[.s3]#didn&#8217;t try to ambush the personas, so the personas send their eloquent spokeswoman out to meet the group.
Her CHA is 17, and she steps towards the #[.s14]#apparent leader of the other group.
The pre-#[.s6]#greeting die roll is adjusted by +10% for a preferred anthro type (humanoid to humanoid), and +34% for CHA (CHA > #[.s1]#16 is added twice).
The pre-greeting die roll of 55 #[.s7]#is adjusted to 99, which indicates &#8216;give full #[.s1]#assistance&#8217;.
The new found referee personas may help open the jammed door.
