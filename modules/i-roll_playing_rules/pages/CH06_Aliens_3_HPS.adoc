= Alien Hit Points

Alien HPS depend on their size and their CON.
The alien's size determines the type of die that is used to generate the alien's HPS and the alien's CON determines how many times the die is rolled.

A large alien with a 9 CON would roll 9d10 to determine her alien's HPS.
The numbers generated on each die are cumulated as the person's HPS.
If the player had rolled 4, 5, 2, 6, 8, 3, 5, 6 and 7, her alien would have 46 HPS.
The HPS max and the dice rolled should be recorded on the personal record sheet of the alien.

== Alien Death and HPS
Aliens do not die the same as anthros or robots.
An alien is dead if her HPS total reaches zero.
There is no bleeding out shock state like anthros.
There is no let's start again more broken result like robots.
Aliens are not subject to damage system shock or recovery rolls. 

Aliens are also dead if an attribute is reduced to zero.
